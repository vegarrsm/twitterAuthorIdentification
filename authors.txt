I continue to be inspired by all of the volunteers (including many retired health care workers and teachers) on the front lines of the fight against coronavirus each day. 

Here are five books to read this summer if you want to learn more about pandemics or are looking for a distraction: https://t.co/B5AX6d7uah 

Melinda recommended that I read The Choice, and I’m glad she did. I think many people will find comfort right now from Dr. Edith Eva Eger's suggestions on how to handle difficult situations. 

Today is #RedNoseDay. Their work has made an incredible impact to reduce child poverty in the US and around the world. 

The 1918 influenza outbreak is the closest comparison to what we’re living through right now. John Barry does a great job explaining the realities and lessons of that devastating pandemic. 

Most of my conversations these days are about COVID-19 and how we can stem the tide, but I’m also often asked about what I am reading and watching. Here are my 2020 summer book recommendations (plus a few other ideas for things to do at home). 

I’m hopeful that this program will improve our understanding of the coronavirus outbreak in Seattle and provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world. 

Class of 2020, these are not easy times. But we will get through them. And with your leadership, the world will be stronger than before. 

There are over 100 different coronavirus vaccine candidates in the works. These candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19: https://t.co/sFTGWFLgIq 

Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. It’s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know we’ll get it done. There’s simply no alternative.

"Authoritarian leaders like China's Xi Jinping bend the law to serve their purposes and reinforce their power. Trump is trying to do the same," Rebecca MacKinnon writes for @CNNOpinion 

Zimbabwe summoned the US ambassador in Harare Monday after US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien referred to the nation as a foreign adversary and suggested it was taking advantage of protests over the killing of George Floyd to foment unrest 

President Trump said he'd support laws criminalizing flag burning, saying in a call with governors that it's time for the Supreme Court to take up the issue again as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of George Floyd 

Judge Emmet Sullivan defended his authority to keep control of the Michael Flynn case and his decision to appoint an outside lawyer to review it, even after the Justice Department asked him to dismiss it 

Five people, including a 15-year-old girl, have died of Ebola in a fresh outbreak of the virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo, UNICEF says. Nine cases total have been reported, according to the organization. 

"This has been a really tough balance because I feel helpless. I feel angry. I feel frustrated." Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms says she's trying to find balance between criticizing police officers and supporting ones who protect the city amid protests 

Tear gas is fired at peaceful protesters near the White House as President Trump says he's mobilizing the military and declares himself "your president of law and order" 

An independent autopsy called George Floyd's death a homicide and determined he died of "asphyxiation from sustained pressure" — a finding that is at odds with the medical examiner 

Protests across America boil over into violence for the sixth straight night. CNN legal analyst and Minneapolis native Laura Coates joins #TheDailyDC to talk about what's really happening in the city and examine the nationwide movement. https://t.co/LgWFDZHcxD
