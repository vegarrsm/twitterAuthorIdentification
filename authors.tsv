0	@BillGates	a	I was honored to speak at today’s #LeadersClimateSummit about the three things we need to do to avoid a climate disaster. 
1	@BillGates	a	Ambitious short-term goals like this are critical to moving closer to a net-zero future. As we rapidly scale the solutions we have, we must also invest in innovation to reach our ultimate goals. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership. 
2	@BillGates	a	It’s encouraging to see @POTUS Biden and @ClimateEnvoy Kerry re-establish America’s leading role on climate change. I look forward to joining leaders from around the world to talk about some of the most important challenges we need to overcome to avoid a climate disaster. 
3	@BillGates	a	“Time” is a poetic portrait of a family who love and support each other despite their difficult circumstances. I can’t recommend it highly enough. 
4	@BillGates	a	If “Time” wins the Oscar this year, it will be the first documentary directed by a Black woman to do so. Garrett Bradley’s talent makes her worthy of that milestone. This is one of the most intimate movies I have ever seen. #itsTIME 
5	@BillGates	a	Communities of color have been hit hard by COVID-19. One of the reasons why parts of the medical system often fail Black and brown people is because it’s not designed with them in mind. Dr. Stephaun Wallace wants to change that. 
6	@BillGates	a	To get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050, leaders from around the world must work together. It’s encouraging to see governments, business leaders, and financial institutions committing to a successful COP26 in Glasgow later this year. 
7	@BillGates	a	Dr. Stephaun Wallace (@imstephaunelite) has spent the last year helping make COVID-19 vaccines work for everybody. Stephaun and his colleagues at @FredHutch are working to reach the people who are usually left behind. 
8	@BillGates	a	The amount of cement China has consumed is a staggering statistic and reminder of how much emissions have grown in low- and middle-income countries. (Minecraft concrete doesn’t count, though server farms are responsible for a lot of emissions.) https://t.co/b8tSNNdUBy 
9	@BillGates	a	Cement is responsible for 6% of carbon emissions globally. To get to net-zero by 2050, we need innovations to decarbonize the material. I discuss a few approaches to make low-emission cement in my climate book: 
10	@BillGates	a	The best way to prevent new variants from emerging is by stopping transmission of the virus altogether: https://t.co/KhJoM3LBmr 
11	@BillGates	a	It's encouraging to see innovation and clean energy investments at the forefront of @POTUS's #AmericanJobsPlan. Building markets for new energy technologies is good for jobs today and will build the economies we need while avoiding a climate disaster. 
12	@BillGates	a	Here are five things you should know if you want to understand how variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic. 
13	@BillGates	a	The technological transformation we need to address climate change can create good, safe jobs and build a more equitable, prosperous economy. To make that happen, we need to think big: https://t.co/jFWTPyaOAq 
14	@BillGates	a	I had a great time answering questions about my new book, climate change, and COVID-19 on @reddit last week. Here’s a recap of the conversation. 
15	@BillGates	a	I’m answering your questions now on @reddit: https://t.co/HXMsI0lSK1 
16	@BillGates	a	In this video, I answered some really good questions, including one about two really important numbers. Come ask me some questions of your own on @reddit at 11:15: https://t.co/HXMsI0lSK1 
17	@BillGates	a	After you finish your pancakes this morning, come ask me anything on @reddit at 11:15 Pacific Time: https://t.co/R3wfDhtqxD 
18	@BillGates	a	It’s deeply unfair that the people who contribute the least to climate change will suffer the worst from its effects: https://t.co/XciR3lIVzs 
19	@BillGates	a	I named my book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” not “How to Stop Climate Change,” because our climate is already changing—and no one will be hurt more by climate change than the world’s poorest people. Here's how we can help them adapt. 
20	@BillGates	a	Congratulations @AndrewSteerWRI on this important role. I’m excited to see what you and the Earth Fund will achieve. Avoiding a climate disaster is going to take all of us, and I’m grateful for @JeffBezos’s leadership and partnership. 
21	@BillGates	a	Thank you @SalKhanAcademy for a great conversation about climate change and thanks to @BookPeople and @BlueWillowBooks for hosting the event. 
22	@BillGates	a	For decades, Australian researcher Ruth Bishop led global efforts to identify and combat rotavirus. Her life is a reminder of the importance of scientific research to uncover unknown pathogens and the power of vaccines to prevent suffering and save lives. 
23	@BillGates	a	Virologist Ruth Bishop pioneered the research that led to the discovery of rotavirus. Her legacy continues both as a role model for other researchers and in the millions of children’s lives that have been saved because of her heroic work: https://t.co/qjroJpzqTc #IWD2021 
24	@BillGates	a	Thank you @BarackObama for the kind words. Your leadership at the 2015 Paris climate conference helped prove that global cooperation on climate is possible and gives me hope that we can reach our goal of zero emissions. 
25	@BillGates	a	Moving to a green economy is the biggest challenge the world has ever faced. I’m optimistic we can do it, but need to make sure it benefits everyone—including those workers and communities who depend on the fossil fuels that we need to get rid of. 
26	@BillGates	a	We can’t avoid a climate disaster without corporate leaders making courageous decisions now. I hope to work with @VWGroup on building the markets for the clean technologies the world needs. Thank you for the kind words, Herbert. 
27	@BillGates	a	Delivering vaccines to those who need them most, no matter where they live or how much money they have, is the only way to end the pandemic and begin the recovery. This is an important milestone. 
28	@BillGates	a	We're fortunate to have an Energy Secretary who's focused on creating high-quality jobs to build a clean energy economy. I look forward to working with @SecGranholm on clean tech innovation and deployment. 
29	@BillGates	a	Recent extreme weather events are a stark reminder that we’re already seeing the effects of climate change here at home and around the world. This type of observation system will help scientists monitor and predict future weather events. 
30	@BillGates	a	Thanks @kwelkernbc and @JCCAtlanta for a great conversation about how we can avoid a climate disaster. 
31	@BillGates	a	I’m looking forward to joining @andrewrsorkin to talk about climate change, our foundation’s work in response to the pandemic, and more. 
32	@BillGates	a	It’s encouraging to have @ClimateEnvoy John Kerry representing the U.S. to the world. Now that we've rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, it's going to take ambitious action from U.S. leaders and those around the globe to avoid a climate disaster. 
33	@BillGates	a	There are several ways individuals can help move us closer to a zero-carbon future. Here are a few: https://t.co/oTQ5ebQ4yp 
34	@BillGates	a	Thanks @JudyWoodruff and @NewsHour for having me on the show to talk about climate change and COVID-19 – two urgent global issues that need global collaboration. 
35	@BillGates	a	I’m inspired by @DonCheadle’s activism and humanitarian work. Thanks to @lawacthevents and @writersblocla for hosting our discussion about climate change and how everyone can help. 
36	@BillGates	a	Meaningful action from business leaders will require the courage to take risks that many companies aren't used to taking. 
37	@BillGates	a	Thanks to @andersoncooper, @SeaArtsLectures, and everyone who joined our virtual conversation about climate change. Great to have so much support from my hometown for this important work. 
38	@BillGates	a	Great to see this important step as the United States resumes our global leadership on climate change. Looking forward to working with @POTUS and Congress on a plan to ensure we reach net zero by 2050. 
39	@BillGates	a	When I talk to people about climate change, I almost always get asked the same question: What can I do to help? Here are some actions individuals can take to move us closer to a zero-carbon future: 
40	@BillGates	a	Thanks for inviting me on the podcast, @karaswisher. 
41	@BillGates	a	Thank you, @AlokSharma_RDG. We have a lot of work ahead of us to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and avoid a climate disaster. Your leadership of #COP26 is critical. Thanks also to @howtoacademy, @penguinlive and @Waterstones for hosting the London stop of my virtual book tour! 
42	@BillGates	a	It was great to talk with @alroker about my new book and the solutions we need to fight climate change. 
43	@BillGates	a	Thanks for another great conversation @Trevornoah! 
44	@BillGates	a	I wrote How to Avoid a Climate Disaster because I see not just the problem of climate change; I also see an opportunity to solve it. Here’s how: https://t.co/3X4ihy9hMf 
45	@BillGates	a	I had a great time working with @FortuneMagazine on this special digital issue about climate change. The entire business community has a role to play—and we need to start now. 
46	@BillGates	a	How to Avoid a Climate Disaster is available now. I hope you’ll check out the book, but more importantly, I hope you’ll do what you can to help keep the planet livable for generations to come: https://t.co/08U8Bx43eo 
47	@BillGates	a	The world’s power to invent makes me hopeful about climate change. Breakthrough Energy supports the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero emissions. 
48	@BillGates	a	To avoid a climate disaster, we need to eliminate emissions from the ways we create electricity, grow food, make things, move around, and heat and cool our buildings. It won’t be easy, but I believe we can do it. This book is about what it will take. 
49	@BillGates	a	I enjoyed spending time with @andersoncooper recently in Seattle. We talked about why I’m optimistic that the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions and avoid a climate disaster: https://t.co/exodP9bavN 
50	@BillGates	a	I’m thrilled to join @Trevornoah, @AlokSharma_RDG, @iamrashidajones, @andersoncooper, @DonCheadle, @SavannahGuthrie, @kwelkernbc, @daxshepard and Monica Padman, Sal Khan, and Ariel Bissett to discuss how the world can work to avoid a climate disaster: https://t.co/blXhv7fa5l 
51	@BillGates	a	When it comes to preventing pandemics, scientific tools alone aren’t enough. We also need new capabilities, including a global alert system and infectious disease first responders (or what I like to call a pandemic fire squad): https://t.co/53Rf5uvjub 
52	@BillGates	a	COVID-19 has cost lives, sickened millions, and thrust the global economy into a devastating recession. But hope is on the horizon: https://t.co/clsscPwQUD 
53	@BillGates	a	This has been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes. In our new Annual Letter, Melinda and I talk about how we can turn the hard-won lessons of the pandemic into a healthier, more equal future for all. 
54	@BillGates	a	Here are four other ways that America can advance its leadership on climate change this year and put the world on a path to zero emissions by 2050: https://t.co/vxEjYjqAaD 
55	@BillGates	a	One of the benefits of being 65 is that I’m eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. I got my first dose this week, and I feel great. Thank you to all of the scientists, trial participants, regulators, and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point. 
56	@BillGates	a	It’s great to see President Biden elevate science leadership to a cabinet-level position. Congratulations @eric_lander. 
57	@BillGates	a	#MLKDay has long been a national day of service. As we celebrate the first without Congressman John Lewis, I'm thinking about his powerful call to remain hopeful about the future as we work to make our country—and our world—a better place. 
58	@BillGates	a	It’s great to see India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability as the world works to end the COVID-19 pandemic @PMOIndia 
59	@BillGates	a	What does Rashida Jones have on her shopping list? That’s just one of the many questions that didn’t make it into our podcast. You can listen to some of the big questions we did tackle here: https://t.co/RJzHRUPoik 
60	@BillGates	a	2021 will be better than 2020. Here’s why: 
61	@BillGates	a	Standing up for science has never been more important. Congratulations to Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Salim Abdool Karim on receiving this honor. 
62	@BillGates	a	I've known and learned from @RonConway for more than 40 years. I'm glad to see @svangel team up with @bchesky to mentor and support companies working to create more economic empowerment opportunities for people across the world. 
63	@BillGates	a	This book has nothing to do with viruses or pandemics. But it is surprisingly relevant for these times. @exlarson provides a brilliant and gripping account of another era of widespread anxiety: the years 1940 and 1941. 
64	@BillGates	a	Monoclonal antibodies are one of the most promising treatments we have for COVID-19, thanks in large part to R&amp;D by Canadian scientists. Because of their generosity, people all around the world will have access to this potentially lifesaving treatment. 
65	@BillGates	a	Like many people, I’ve tried to deepen my understanding of systemic racism in recent months. If you’re interested in learning more about the lives caught up in our country's justice system, I highly recommend @thenewjimcrow by Michelle Alexander. 
66	@BillGates	a	The season finale of our podcast features two incredible people who are using their positions as artists to change the world for the better. 
67	@BillGates	a	Thanks for the great conversation, Carlos. 
68	@BillGates	a	Bill Foege and Viktor Zdanov are phenomenal examples of what it means to harness science for global health. A well-deserved honor. 
69	@BillGates	a	Here are five books that I’d recommend as we wrap up 2020. I hope you find something that helps you—or the book lover in your life—finish the year on a good note. 
70	@BillGates	a	Are we actually making progress on climate change? Can we really prevent a climate disaster? In this week’s podcast, Rashida and I take on perhaps our biggest question yet with Pulitzer Prize-winning author @ElizKolbert. 
71	@BillGates	a	This new quiz from @Gapminder is a clever way to fight misconceptions and “upgrade your worldview” about the incredible progress the world has made toward the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, fight inequality, and stop climate change: 
72	@BillGates	a	Rashida Jones and I talked to Yuval Noah Harari about COVID conspiracy theories, the role social media plays in spreading misinformation, and the one lie I choose to believe even though I know it’s not always true: https://t.co/7pzUFsMf5D 
73	@BillGates	a	This the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change. 
74	@BillGates	a	I’m inspired by Quarraisha Abdool Karim and @ProfAbdoolKarim. They are two of the most respected HIV/AIDS researchers in the world. And now they are helping guide the COVID-19 response in South Africa and around the globe. 
75	@BillGates	a	I’m a big fan of author @harari_yuval and was excited to talk to him about why humanity is so willing to believe falsehoods and what these lies tell us about ourselves—both as individuals and as a society. 
76	@BillGates	a	Today is the 25th anniversary of my first book, The Road Ahead. I made a lot of predictions about technology in the book, and it was fun to look back and see what I got right (and what I got wrong). 
77	@BillGates	a	This week, Rashida and I ask a big question that has never felt more urgent: is inequality inevitable? We spoke with Compton mayor @AjaLBrown and @OppInsights director Raj Chetty about what it’ll take to build a more equal society. 
78	@BillGates	a	You can listen to a bonus clip that didn’t make it into our latest episode here: https://t.co/5diXiKpEnx 
79	@BillGates	a	Nearly forty million people have Alzheimer’s or dementia today. We have no way to stop or even slow the disease at this point, but I’m hopeful the new Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative (@AlzData) will speed up progress. 
80	@BillGates	a	In our first podcast episode, Rashida Jones and I talked to Dr. Anthony Fauci about what to expect in the coming months and what the world will look like after COVID-19. 
81	@BillGates	a	More than 7 million community health workers serve their neighbors around the world, improving access to primary healthcare for their communities. Now they’re doing heroic work to respond to the pandemic. 
82	@BillGates	a	Each week, we’ll talk about some of the biggest issues facing our world with special guests including authors, experts, and friends. 
83	@BillGates	a	I’m teaming up with Rashida Jones to ask the big questions. Check out our new podcast limited series starting Monday. You can subscribe here: https://t.co/HBBmAHJNP2 
84	@BillGates	a	Here in Washington, we always vote by mail. It's a safe and secure way to shape the future of our country. But regardless of whether you vote by mail or in person this year, I hope you plan to make your voice heard. Visit 
85	@BillGates	a	For decades, @Rotary has worked tirelessly to #EndPolio. Today, the health infrastructure they’ve built around the world is supporting the COVID-19 response. #WorldPolioDay 
86	@BillGates	a	I’ve been working for some time on a book about what we need to do over the next decade to avoid a climate disaster. I’m excited that it will be published on February 16. 
87	@BillGates	a	India’s research and manufacturing capacity are critical for fighting COVID-19. Thank you @narendramodi for speaking at today’s Grand Challenges meeting. @PMOIndia 
88	@BillGates	a	Europe has an opportunity to get its economy back on track in a way that creates good jobs and reinforces its global climate leadership. Here are 55 ideas on how Europe can develop and scale up the innovative technologies we'll need to reach net-zero. 
89	@BillGates	a	The COVID-19 pandemic has set back efforts to end poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Investing in @CGIAR will speed the recovery by helping farmers adapt to climate change and rebuild food systems after the pandemic (via @Nature). 
90	@BillGates	a	.@StephenCurry30’s work in the community is as inspiring as his amazing record on the basketball court. I really appreciated the thoughtful conversation. 
91	@BillGates	a	Dr. Tunji Funsho’s work with @Rotary was essential in stopping wild polio in Africa and will help create a polio-free world for all. A well-deserved recognition. 
92	@BillGates	a	This honor is well deserved. COVID-19 is not just a health crisis—it is also now a food crisis, and @WFP is there to respond. I’m inspired by the thousands of people in the organization who have committed their lives to fighting hunger. 
93	@BillGates	a	For the last 25 years, Dr. Firdausi Qadri, an immunologist and infectious disease researcher in Bangladesh, has been working to protect entire communities from cholera epidemics. 
94	@BillGates	a	I’m excited to see this kind of innovation. Detecting and predicting outbreaks earlier is critical to preventing epidemics. 
95	@BillGates	a	The only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere. By making sure poor countries are equipped to stop this disease, wealthy countries will help themselves and bring this crisis to an end sooner. 
96	@BillGates	a	Understanding this concept can help us measure our progress toward eliminating carbon emissions and serve as a guide to action. 
97	@BillGates	a	Developing and manufacturing vaccines won’t end the pandemic quickly unless we also deliver them equitably. Here is why it’s critical that vaccines are distributed in proportion to the global population: https://t.co/XFTYVZ2C2N 
98	@BillGates	a	Great to see the UK commit vital funding to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available for the world’s poorest people. PM @BorisJohnson's plan will improve the way we prepare for future crises like this. 
99	@BillGates	a	After 20 years of stunning advances toward global goals to improve health and reduce poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped progress in its tracks. In our foundation’s Goalkeepers report, we survey the damage and discuss how to start reversing it. 
100	@BillGates	a	To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need innovation across all sectors—especially in the hardest to decarbonize sectors—to get us on a viable path to net-zero emissions. 
101	@BillGates	a	Dr. John Nkengasong is a true Goalkeeper. His leadership will help ensure Africa has the tools it needs to fight COVID-19: https://t.co/E0gxmT6ahF 
102	@BillGates	a	Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who devoted her entire career to fighting for equal justice for women, because she knew it would improve life for everyone. America is a better place because of her service. I am inspired by her life and legacy. 
103	@BillGates	a	Thank you to the heroes everywhere working to keep us safe. I hope their stories inspire you just as much as they have me: https://t.co/DYFUYMEPK7 
104	@BillGates	a	These heroes represent the best of who we can be. Their efforts to solve the world’s challenges demonstrate our values as a society and they serve as powerful examples of how to make a positive difference in the world. 
105	@BillGates	a	Clinical trials are critical to helping researchers better understand Alzheimer's. Improving how we identify and enroll participants in those trials will accelerate progress on diagnosing and treating the disease. 
106	@BillGates	a	I tackle every big new problem by asking two questions: Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them? @ExemplarsHealth will help to fill the gap in global health knowledge sharing and to accelerate progress in saving lives. 
107	@BillGates	a	Of all the things I’ve learned from Warren Buffett (and there have been a lot), the most important might be what friendship is all about. Here’s why he’s a person that I admire as well as like: 
108	@BillGates	a	Happy 90th birthday, Warren! 
109	@BillGates	a	If we’re going to address climate change, we need to find new ways to do things that don’t release greenhouse gases—including how we move around. 
110	@BillGates	a	Today we move one step closer toward a world without polio. This is an incredible milestone that’s worth celebrating. It is also an important reminder of what can be accomplished when we work together toward a common goal. 
111	@BillGates	a	Mosquito City is home to the world’s largest captive colony of mosquitoes. @IfakaraHealth Institute is doing fascinating research there about mosquito behaviors and finding ways to outsmart them. 
112	@BillGates	a	Deaths from malaria have been cut by more than half since the year 2000. Increased bed net use is one of the main reasons why 
113	@BillGates	a	Ridding the world of preventable, treatable diseases like malaria will save millions of lives and lead to healthier, more prosperous communities. And that will make them better prepared to confront any new health challenges like COVID-19 in the future. https://t.co/6AbgoLSVai 
114	@BillGates	a	The progress the world has made against malaria is one of the greatest success stories ever. The COVID-19 pandemic only reinforces why eradicating malaria is so essential. 
115	@BillGates	a	Move aside, @SharkWeek. This is the still the world’s deadliest killer: https://t.co/AOi5VSmfLF 
116	@BillGates	a	Because of long-standing barriers that are made worse by COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of students with promise may never start college. This would be disastrous for these young people and for the country. Here’s what we’re doing to help: 
117	@BillGates	a	Teaching special education takes an amazing person to figure out exactly what works for each child. Talking with Washington State Teacher of the Year Amy Campbell gave me an even greater appreciation for these educators: https://t.co/YIxI1eoMkG 
118	@BillGates	a	Our foundation is partnering with @DonorsChoose to support teachers as they get ready to go back to school—in whatever form that takes—and will boost your donations to the classroom project of your choice today. 
119	@BillGates	a	I always look forward to meeting Washington’s Teacher of the Year. This year’s recipient, Amy Campbell (@The_MrsCampbell), is a remarkable advocate for her students, and I loved learning about her approach to teaching special ed. 
120	@BillGates	a	Bill Foege was instrumental in the effort to eradicate smallpox (and is a personal hero of mine). Here he outlines how lessons learned from that campaign can apply to the fight against COVID-19. 
121	@BillGates	a	Great tips from @CT_Bergstrom about how to find reliable sources of information and test claims you may see about the pandemic in your social media feeds. 
122	@BillGates	a	If we learn the lessons of COVID-19, we can approach climate change more informed about the consequences of inaction, and more prepared to save lives and prevent the worst possible outcome. 
123	@BillGates	a	The impacts of COVID-19 are driving worrying increases in malnutrition and health outcomes. However, there are clear actions that can be taken in both the near- and long-term. 
124	@BillGates	a	In these challenging times, we can’t lose sight of the importance of combatting climate change. I’m excited to hear about how companies like @Microsoft are finding a way to play a role. 
125	@BillGates	a	Science and innovation will help us beat COVID-19. Dr. Fauci explains why. 
126	@BillGates	a	It’s important that we continue to follow scientific data as we look for new tools to aid in the fight against coronavirus.  
127	@BillGates	a	It’s hard to overstate how important finding a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic is for stopping Alzheimer’s. This is a big step towards that goal. 
128	@BillGates	a	Investments in digital technology that strengthen Africa’s food and health security will be critical to help the continent recover and thrive after the pandemic. 
129	@BillGates	a	"""Our best strategy in the age-old fight against the germs is our collaborative, data-based effort to study the world around us and within us. Our best strategy is science."" @MaxCRoser explains how vaccines have dramatically improved humanity’s ability to fight infectious disease. "
130	@BillGates	a	This is a great loss for America, and for everyone who believes in making the world a more just place. John Lewis not only saw that our country could be better--he never stopped working to make it that way. We need leaders like him more than ever. 
131	@BillGates	a	Globally, a lack of medical oxygen–needed to treat pneumonia, malaria, and other diseases–leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. @BernardOlayo founded @Hewa_Tele to address this often-overlooked challenge. 
132	@BillGates	a	This hero is playing a critical role in Kenya’s preparations to tackle COVID-19 by scaling up medical oxygen supplies that will be needed to keep the most critically ill patients alive. 
133	@BillGates	a	I continue to be inspired by all of the volunteers (including many retired health care workers and teachers) on the front lines of the fight against coronavirus each day. 
134	@BillGates	a	Here are five books to read this summer if you want to learn more about pandemics or are looking for a distraction: https://t.co/B5AX6d7uah 
135	@BillGates	a	Melinda recommended that I read The Choice, and I’m glad she did. I think many people will find comfort right now from Dr. Edith Eva Eger's suggestions on how to handle difficult situations. 
136	@BillGates	a	Today is #RedNoseDay. Their work has made an incredible impact to reduce child poverty in the US and around the world. 
137	@BillGates	a	The 1918 influenza outbreak is the closest comparison to what we’re living through right now. John Barry does a great job explaining the realities and lessons of that devastating pandemic. 
138	@BillGates	a	Most of my conversations these days are about COVID-19 and how we can stem the tide, but I’m also often asked about what I am reading and watching. Here are my 2020 summer book recommendations (plus a few other ideas for things to do at home). 
139	@BillGates	a	I’m hopeful that this program will improve our understanding of the coronavirus outbreak in Seattle and provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world. 
140	@BillGates	a	Class of 2020, these are not easy times. But we will get through them. And with your leadership, the world will be stronger than before. 
141	@BillGates	a	There are over 100 different coronavirus vaccine candidates in the works. These candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19: https://t.co/sFTGWFLgIq 
142	@BillGates	a	Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. It’s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know we’ll get it done. There’s simply no alternative. 
143	@BillGates	a	We don't yet have all the tools we need to stop the novel coronavirus and safely re-open the economy. But they are on the horizon. 
144	@BillGates	a	This is a great introduction to computer science concepts for students at all levels. I’m looking forward to joining today’s Code Break. 
145	@BillGates	a	.@NickKristof does an amazing job capturing the heroism of the health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus fight. 
146	@BillGates	a	On #WorldHealthDay — and every day — I want to thank all of the health heroes for their sacrifices and for keeping us safe. 
147	@BillGates	a	I always enjoy chatting with @Trevornoah, even though we had to sit a little bit further apart than usual this time. 
148	@BillGates	a	It’s encouraging to see the first projects begin from our effort to accelerate safe and effective drugs for #COVID19. 
149	@BillGates	a	I’m excited to join the @khanacademy Daily Homeroom today to talk about the incredible ways parents, teachers, and students are coming together to keep learning while schools are closed. 
150	@BillGates	a	If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work. You can read more about my thoughts on #COVID19 on my blog. 
151	@BillGates	a	There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. 
152	@BillGates	a	There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. 
153	@BillGates	a	I’m inspired by the generosity of everyone who has contributed to this effort to help keep kids learning at home. Thank you to @DonorsChoose and especially the educators who are doing amazing things for their students every day. 
154	@BillGates	a	One of the questions I am most often asked about the #COVID19 pandemic is how, and when, it will end. This article by @edyong209 does a really good job of outlining the steps we need to take. 
155	@BillGates	a	This impressive new tool from @IHME_UW will help hospitals, policymakers, and the general public better understand and prepare for the #COVID19 response in the U.S. 
156	@BillGates	a	This is encouraging news, but we still have a lot of work to do. Extreme physical distancing and testing are the best tools we have right now to slow the spread of novel coronavirus. 
157	@BillGates	a	There are few people I’ve learned more from over the years–especially about viruses–than Peter Piot. This Q&amp;A with him is an excellent, easy-to-understand primer on #COVID19: https://t.co/dBntxKnybd 
158	@BillGates	a	Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister @erna_solberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines. 
159	@BillGates	a	The international response will require funding for @CEPIVaccines’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine and for @Gavi. Thanks to @BorisJohnson and the UK for this vital commitment. 
160	@BillGates	a	Lots of people in Seattle have asked how they can help those impacted by #COVID19 locally. @allinseattle has done a great job identifying organizations who are already on the ground and deploying resources quickly to help our friends and neighbors: https://t.co/SfjeWBBmNu 
161	@BillGates	a	Thanks for your leadership, @rogerfederer. This is an inspiring contribution and will make a big difference for families. 
162	@BillGates	a	Teachers are doing incredible work to keep kids learning while at home. To help get supplies to those most in need, Melinda and I will double your impact, up to $1 million total, when you give to @DonorsChoose coronavirus relief effort today and tomorrow. 
163	@BillGates	a	I’m connecting live with @TEDchris and @WhitPennRod to talk about what our healthcare systems need to tackle the #COVID19 pandemic and prepare for future epidemics. 
164	@BillGates	a	Thanks @reddit for joining me yesterday to discuss the #COVID19 pandemic and what we can do to prevent the next one. Here's a recap of the conversation: https://t.co/RUtVlxIst0 
165	@BillGates	a	I’m answering your questions about the #COVID19 coronavirus on @reddit in 10 minutes: https://t.co/JXEYRCpCza 
166	@BillGates	a	I know many parents are looking for resources and ideas to help their kids continue learning while home. @khanacademy has created daily schedules with interactive content--exercises, videos and articles--for students in every grade. 
167	@BillGates	a	We don’t yet have all the tools we need to fight COVID-19. This is an important step toward having treatments, while we also explore vaccines and diagnostics. Thanks to @wellcometrust and @mastercard for launching this effort with us. 
168	@BillGates	a	COVID-19 could be a once-in-a-century pandemic, but the good news is that there are steps we can take now to slow its impact and help us respond more effectively when the next epidemic arrives. #COVID19 
169	@BillGates	a	1 in 4 children under five in South Africa are stunted. The @GrowGreatZA Campaign is empowering new and pregnant moms to keep their children healthy. Here’s why I’m optimistic that they can make an impact: https://t.co/a97kqWCycu 
170	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I have met many stunted children in our travels. It’s heartbreaking and utterly preventable. Dr. @kopanomabaso is leading an incredible effort to eliminate child stunting from South Africa over the next decade. 
171	@BillGates	a	Climate change is one of the toughest challenges the world has ever taken on. But I believe we can avoid a climate catastrophe if we take steps now to reduce emissions and find ways to adapt to a warmer world. Here’s how we’re approaching the challenge: https://t.co/MtZAZHrHyJ 
172	@BillGates	a	When Warren Buffett donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation and joined us as a partner in its work, he urged us to “swing for the fences.” All these years later, that advice still guides how we think about our philanthropy: https://t.co/lmpKbixhOZ 
173	@BillGates	a	Diseases that cause dementia are only diagnosed after symptoms start. To effectively treat these diseases, we need to be able to diagnose them decades earlier when they first take hold in the brain. 
174	@BillGates	a	We’re hopeful that our foundation’s work with Networks for School Improvement will help increase the number of Black, Latinx, and low-income students who graduate from high school and pursue postsecondary opportunities. Here’s why that’s so important: https://t.co/Kc5iCU6qhE 
175	@BillGates	a	It was a magical night. I'm very happy to support your foundation's incredible work. 
176	@BillGates	a	Vaccines are a miracle. But how exactly do they work? I explain the science behind vaccines and why our foundation’s investment in them is one of the best we’ve ever made: https://t.co/fwpQOp93kb 
177	@BillGates	a	Science is giving us the opportunity to improve lives around the world faster than ever before. Today I was honored to give a speech on this subject at the @aaas annual meeting. #AAASmtg 
178	@BillGates	a	This is an incredible story about the power of vaccines. 13 million people are alive today thanks to @Gavi. Here’s how: https://t.co/3Zyw9mIqYu 
179	@BillGates	a	The only way we'll achieve net-zero carbon emissions is if we innovate, deploy, and invest across all sectors. It's encouraging to see companies working to get our planet one step closer. Congratulations to all the winners of the #BreakthroughCanada initiative. 
180	@BillGates	a	When we first started our foundation, Melinda and I were optimistic about the power of innovation to drive progress. Twenty years later, we’re just as optimistic, and we’re still swinging for the fences: https://t.co/xF4YpnawpN 
181	@BillGates	a	In our new annual letter, @melindagates and I write about why we think the risks we’ve taken in the first two decades of our foundation have set us up for future progress. 
182	@BillGates	a	@rogerfederer @RafaelNadal @Trevornoah Roger’s foundation partners with local NGOs in six countries in southern Africa to improve early learning and basic education. It’s an impressive organization, and I encourage you to consider supporting its work: 
183	@BillGates	a	I’m excited to team up with @rogerfederer again for the Match in Africa Friday in Cape Town. Playing alongside Roger is always a thrill, and I can’t wait to face off against @RafaelNadal and @Trevornoah. 
184	@BillGates	a	As we conclude our foundation’s second decade of work in global health and education, I have never been more optimistic about the opportunity to improve life for the world’s poorest. I look forward to partnering with you on the work ahead. 
185	@BillGates	a	Thank you, Sue, for all of your contributions to our foundation. I look forward to continuing our work together on important health and education projects that will improve lives. 
186	@BillGates	a	Game on! 
187	@BillGates	a	If the world keeps up the fight against these neglected tropical diseases, we can improve the lives of millions of families: https://t.co/Naourwhu9i #WorldNTDDay 
188	@BillGates	a	The world has only begun to tap into all the ways AI will help people live healthier lives. I’m excited about the launch of @Microsoft’s new AI for Health initiative, which connects researchers and organizations with world-class AI talent and resources. 
189	@BillGates	a	I joined @Twitter ten years (and a couple of days) ago. These are some of my favorite tweets. What’s your favorite tweet from the last ten years? 
190	@BillGates	a	For twenty years, @gavi has worked to ensure that every child in the world is protected from preventable diseases. The results are incredible. But their work is far from done. 
191	@BillGates	a	I had a fascinating conversation with Vaclav Smil about what bacteria, babies, empires, and economies all have in common: https://t.co/HUE9aiFLZz 
192	@BillGates	a	It's great to see Microsoft's leadership in this area. Avoiding the worst effects of climate change will require innovation and investment to get us to net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy. 
193	@BillGates	a	These global health heroes have helped Bangladesh become a model for other countries for how to respond to infectious disease outbreaks: https://t.co/5CEHpFCklp 
194	@BillGates	a	It’s encouraging to see these results. Typhoid is especially deadly for young children, and a vaccine like this has the potential to save millions of lives. 
195	@BillGates	a	Thanks to the work of this father–daughter dynamic duo, Bangladesh is moving toward a future of fewer disease outbreaks and more children reaching their fifth birthday. 
196	@BillGates	a	Solving the world’s toughest challenges—like fighting the worst impacts of climate change—requires lots of new ideas and talented people working across many fields. I’m glad to see this effort to support this important work. 
197	@BillGates	a	Progress isn’t always easy to see. These charts show some of the ways that the world is getting better. 
198	@BillGates	a	America’s tax system will be top of mind for many in 2020. Here’s what I really think. 
199	@BillGates	a	If your New Year’s resolution is to be healthier in 2020, this book is a good place to start. 
200	@BillGates	a	I’m glad @beautiful__news is highlighting some of the amazing things happening in the world. 
201	@BillGates	a	Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite thinkers, and I couldn’t wait to get my hands on his new book about the growth of *everything*. 
202	@BillGates	a	What’s next for our foundation? I’m particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines. 
203	@BillGates	a	I’ve read a lot of books about history over the years, and These Truths by Jill Lepore is the most honest and unflinching account of the American story I’ve ever seen. It’s also one of the most beautifully written. 
204	@BillGates	a	Check out my end of year books list (plus a bonus recommendation) on @Likewise. 
205	@BillGates	a	December is a great time to take stock of everything you’ve done over the last twelve months—including all of the books you’ve read. I found these books to be really clever and engaging. I hope you them find as intriguing as I did: https://t.co/xKdpvoXbvR 
206	@BillGates	a	Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. I even stayed up two nights in a row on occasion–I don’t recommend that. This book taught me a lot about the importance of a better night's sleep. 
207	@BillGates	a	This new treatment is a gamechanger for millions of people living with HIV in South Africa. I’m optimistic that it could help #EndAIDS around the world. 
208	@BillGates	a	I was deeply moved by Tayari Jones’s story of a married couple whose lives get torn apart by an incident of injustice. The book is so well-written that you’ll find yourself sucked into it despite the heavy subject matter. 
209	@BillGates	a	Here are two amazing statistics: primary health care interventions could save 60 million lives in low-and middle-income countries and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030: https://t.co/VfDzACwTNu #HealthForAll 
210	@BillGates	a	Diane Tavenner had a simple but very ambitious goal: “We wanted to teach kids not just what they needed to get into college, but what they needed to live a good life.” You can read an excerpt from her wonderful new book on my blog. 
211	@BillGates	a	I’ve read a lot of great books this year. Here are some I think you’ll enjoy reading over the holidays. 
212	@BillGates	a	I'm a big fan of @SiliconHBO and was excited when they asked me to appear in the series finale tonight. #AlwaysBlue 
213	@BillGates	a	Thank you, Sue, for your extraordinary leadership. Melinda and I are grateful for the opportunity we’ve had to learn with and from you over the past five-and-a-half years, and we wish you and your family the best. 
214	@BillGates	a	I really enjoyed sitting down with @reidhoffman to talk about the role great cofounders and partners have played in my career, like Paul Allen at Microsoft and @melindagates at the Gates Foundation. You can listen to our conversation here: https://t.co/GlFWwylYcI 
215	@BillGates	a	Technology has made it faster and easier than ever before for people everywhere to give. I’m inspired by how many people from all over the world participate in #GivingTuesday. https://t.co/CkwcQb5roI 
216	@BillGates	a	I was impressed to see the tremendous impact @Gestamp’s apprenticeship program is having on students and their community: https://t.co/VFuOrRM9ms 
217	@BillGates	a	This #WorldAIDSDay, I’m excited about breakthroughs in treating and preventing HIV thanks to organizations like the @GlobalFund. 
218	@BillGates	a	The world has made incredible strides toward ending the AIDS epidemic over the last twenty years, and I’m optimistic that more progress is on the way. Explore the data: 
219	@BillGates	a	At @Gestamp, an auto parts maker in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I saw how the factory is putting high school students on a path to opportunity: https://t.co/EAB1Enj48G 
220	@BillGates	a	Dr. LeAndrea Ware is one of the most energetic school leaders I’ve ever met. Her positivity is infectious. It’s no wonder she was recently named the Tennessee principal of the year: https://t.co/wGwZju8qS7 
221	@BillGates	a	We’re getting closer to having a blood test for Alzheimer’s – which could help doctors detect and diagnose the disease earlier: https://t.co/L6m5WYhova 
222	@BillGates	a	US education may be the hardest issue our foundation works on. A recent visit to The Howard School in Chattanooga, Tennessee reminded me why it’s also one of the most inspiring. 
223	@BillGates	a	You could find wild poliovirus in 125 countries in 1988. Today, it exists in just two. And more than 18 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralyzed by polio. Here’s why we aren’t done yet: https://t.co/uXZoglQS7Z 
224	@BillGates	a	The incredible, diverse global partnership that halted wild polio’s spread in Nigeria 3 years ago makes me optimistic we’ll #EndPolio worldwide. 
225	@BillGates	a	Some of our most vital partners in the fight to #EndPolio are philanthropies like @alwaleed_philan, @bloombergdotorg, Tahir Foundation, Dalio Philanthropies &amp; Ningxia Yanbao Charity Foundation. Their support has helped deliver vaccines and protect millions from polio paralysis. 
226	@BillGates	a	Even a single child paralyzed by polio is one too many, but I’m optimistic that we will eradicate the disease thanks to the GPEI’s persistence and creativity. 
227	@BillGates	a	In Abu Dhabi this week, the world committed $2.6B to #EndPolio. Thank you @MohamedBinZayed for your leadership in helping push this terrible disease to the brink of eradication. 
228	@BillGates	a	The more I’ve learned about Alzheimer’s disease, the more I’ve come to admire the volunteers who participate in clinical trials, and their caregivers too. Here’s a way you can help fight Alzheimer’s: https://t.co/isfZoyZFPU 
229	@BillGates	a	Better tools for collecting and sharing data will help community health workers protect families in the poorest parts of the world.  
230	@BillGates	a	Expanding the diversity of therapies in the pipeline and more efficiently recruiting patients for clinical trials will increase our odds of discovering a breakthrough. I’m hopeful it will lead to an intervention that reduces the impact of Alzheimer’s. 
231	@BillGates	a	One of the many awful things about watching someone you love struggle with Alzheimer’s is the feeling of helplessness. You keep thinking that there must be something more you can do. Here's one option. 
232	@BillGates	a	Buildings are one of the five areas where we need a lot of innovation if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster. I wrote about one company with a particularly clever approach. 
233	@BillGates	a	A lot of work remains, but it’s exciting to see positive data on a drug candidate that may alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease. 
234	@BillGates	a	I always like to try out a new TV show or two when I’m on the road. What should I watch next? I set up an Ask on @Likewise to collect your recommendations. 
235	@BillGates	a	"""This is a solvable problem."" @CarbonCure (which I’ve helped fund through @btenergy Ventures) has developed an innovative way to reduce cement's carbon footprint: https://t.co/9gvmkPGtnT "
236	@BillGates	a	One of the best parts of my job is getting to work with some of the world’s most brilliant minds on seemingly intractable problems. Here’s how we’re trying to tackle one of the defining technical challenges of our time. 
237	@BillGates	a	This is one of the most important topics in medicine today: how can we make data more readily available for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment. 
238	@BillGates	a	The world has made incredible progress toward the goal to #endpolio thanks to partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE. 
239	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I feel pressure to make every dollar and every day count, which is why we say no to a lot more opportunities than we say yes to. Working with partners around the world to #EndPolio has been a fight worth every dollar. 
240	@BillGates	a	Tackling the world’s toughest health challenges requires the best that science has to offer. Thank you to @NIHDirector and @WHOAFRO for your partnership. 
241	@BillGates	a	Congrats to the 2019 winners of the @NobelPrize in chemistry! Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery, and the quest to build a better one is an important step in the fight against climate change. 
242	@BillGates	a	Malnutrition is the single greatest health inequity in the world. In its 2019 State of the World’s Children report, @UNICEF takes a critical look at how we can help everyone reach their full potential by improving access to nutrition. 
243	@BillGates	a	The world’s poorest people often rely on farming both to feed their families and to earn an income. They will be among the first to face the effects of climate change. I’m excited about innovations aimed at addressing this problem: https://t.co/H7KrSXFo4b 
244	@BillGates	a	Congrats to Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer for winning this year’s @NobelPrize in economics. I’ve learned a lot from their pioneering work to better understand the complexities of the lives of the world’s poorest people. 
245	@BillGates	a	The world is facing a crisis at the dinner table, one that climate change will only worsen. I’m optimistic about the progress being made by @RIPEproject on a much-needed breakthrough. 
246	@BillGates	a	The odds of dying of AIDS in South Africa are less than half what they were at the peak. That progress wouldn’t have been possible without the @GlobalFund and other global health organizations. Even more progress is possible if we keep up the fight: https://t.co/71W2exSVZT 
247	@BillGates	a	We need more approaches to stopping #Alzheimers disease. I’m excited to see this news out of @DZNE_de and @ISD_Research about a promising starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies. 
248	@BillGates	a	I’m impressed by the international cooperation that made this year’s @GlobalFund Replenishment round possible. The world has committed more than ever before. Our foundation is proud to commit $700 million to over the next 3 years. #StepUptheFight 
249	@BillGates	a	I can’t think of a more fitting tribute to Hans Rosling and his life’s work. Hans was a dear friend to Melinda and me – and inspired us all with his passion, intelligence, and wit. 
250	@BillGates	a	I’m in Lyon, France for the @GlobalFund’s replenishment – celebrating the most money ever raised for their life-saving work. I’m excited for the day that these diseases are in the history books. #StepUptheFight 
251	@BillGates	a	In Afghanistan, one of the last countries with polio, vaccine acceptance rates have reached 98% thanks to the tireless work of female health workers. Their increased involvement and passion is why polio eradication is within reach in Afghanistan. 
252	@BillGates	a	If all countries in the world had the same concentration of researchers as wealthy ones, there would be 3x as many researchers. That’s mind-blowing. We all lose out when talent isn’t connected with opportunity. @OurWorldInData 
253	@BillGates	a	Malnutrition is the greatest health inequity in the world. I recently spoke with my friend @AlikoDangote about how we can use iodized salt to help kids gets the nutrients they need: https://t.co/PXp3WeJfEy 
254	@BillGates	a	I’m lucky to have known Stephen Hawking — and he was as exceptional in person as you imagined he was. As remarkable as his contributions to physics were, his biggest accomplishment was inspiring the world to believe in the magic of science and research. 
255	@BillGates	a	Here is the story of the day I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and the influence of someone who’s been a critical guide along the way: https://t.co/KWOicXCab6 
256	@BillGates	a	Melinda's work on behalf of women and girls around the world inspires me every day. She's committing $1 billion over the next ten years to increasing women's power and influence in the United States. Because #EqualityCantWait. 
257	@BillGates	a	I’m delighted that @erna_solberg has re-upped Norway’s commitment to support the work of the @GlobalFund. I welcome her sustained leadership and partnership in the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria. 
258	@BillGates	a	Most people know @AlikoDangote as Africa’s wealthiest man, but I know him as one of our foundation’s most impactful partners in improving health. Melinda and I are lucky to count him as a partner (and friend!) in our work. 
259	@BillGates	a	More and more children are living to see their 5th birthdays. That’s because the world has made incredible progress in reducing child mortality. But progress has been uneven. We have more work to do to close the gaps across countries and within them. 
260	@BillGates	a	It's really incredible how much time and effort goes into producing a documentary like the new @netflix series I participated in. I shared more about the experience on my blog: https://t.co/BgTeiguaFf 
261	@BillGates	a	Ending poverty and achieving the SDGs requires a whole-of-government approach. @ImranKhanPTI and @SaniaNishtar have shown leadership in developing a new anti-poverty strategy. #Ehsaas 
262	@BillGates	a	.@sanchezcastejon’s commitment to the @GlobalFund reflects Spain’s leadership. At a time when more countries are turning inward, Spain is showing that we can’t back away from our commitment to fighting poverty and disease. 
263	@BillGates	a	Sanitation is a difficult issue to take on because there are no easy solutions. Tonight we recognized the progress India has made on this issue through its Swachh Bharat program, under the leadership of @narendramodi. 
264	@BillGates	a	I had the privilege of meeting @DrElvisEze at last year’s Malaria Summit in London, and I was struck by his optimism about the fight against malaria. I think you’ll be inspired by his story. 
265	@BillGates	a	I’m excited to see world leaders and climate advocates coming together to make progress at the UNGA #ClimateAction Summit. Working together we can prevent the worst effects of climate change. 
266	@BillGates	a	I’ve always loved playing tennis. Maybe this is why. See more deleted scenes from the @netflix series about my life and read exclusive stories on my blog: https://t.co/bjWwDvqQkc 
267	@BillGates	a	I am hopeful that we can substantially alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease. This World Alzheimer’s Day, join me in supporting Alzheimer’s research by watching and sharing @AlzResearchUK’s #SharetheOrange video with @SamuelLJackson. 
268	@BillGates	a	The docuseries about my life and work is out today. I hope you’ll check it out on @netflix — and then read some of the stories that didn’t make the cut on my blog. 
269	@BillGates	a	Adapting to climate change requires support from governments and businesses to ensure those most at risk have the opportunity to thrive. A new report from @GCAdaptation lays out steps we can take to address this urgent issue. 
270	@BillGates	a	The new docuseries that looks at my work is out tomorrow. I hope you check it out on @netflix. I can’t wait to hear what you think: https://t.co/1UXX3xEja5. 
271	@BillGates	a	As governments invest more in primary health care systems, overall health outcomes improve. Here’s how: https://t.co/GqQ8EHynUP 
272	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I started out ahead. But hundreds of millions of people around the world have to overcome hurdle after hurdle to be successful. Read about how advocates are working to even the odds for everyone: https://t.co/w0DQYCunTK 
273	@BillGates	a	Health and education are improving everywhere in the world. But the gap between countries’ progress can be enormous. Our foundation’s 2019 Goalkeepers report examines two of the biggest factors responsible for this inequality: https://t.co/TQjcnNbu2y 
274	@BillGates	a	The Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award is a well-deserved recognition of @gavi's life-saving work. Congratulations to all of the winners: 
275	@BillGates	a	Congratulations @BradSmi and @CarolAnnBrowne! Your insights have never been more relevant, and I am glad others will have the chance to benefit from them too. 
276	@BillGates	a	Today, it’s difficult for researchers to diagnose #Alzheimers patients early enough to intervene. A reliable, easy and accurate diagnostic would be a game changer, and artificial intelligence could be the answer. 
277	@BillGates	a	Here’s a remarkable statistic: Nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme poverty today than in 1990.  But over 700 million still live on less than $2 a day. Six of them share their stories, their challenges, and their dreams for better lives. 
278	@BillGates	a	Manufacturing steel is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Boston Metal is working to change this, and I’m excited about their approach: https://t.co/3xp7NCHPio 
279	@BillGates	a	Tuberculosis is still the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. To #EndTB, we need to continue to develop safer and simpler solutions. The FDA’s approval of a new treatment is a promising step in the right direction. 
280	@BillGates	a	Germany, Italy, and the European Commission have demonstrated great leadership with their commitments to the @GlobalFund. Thank you @BMZ_Bund, @GiuseppeConteIT and @EU_Commission. Your pledges will help protect the world’s most vulnerable from #AIDS, #TB, and #malaria. 
281	@BillGates	a	When I think about the world I want for my children, I know that #EqualityCantWait. When women and men can reach their full potential, everyone benefits: 
282	@BillGates	a	Canada’s $930 million commitment to the @GlobalFund is a big step towards saving millions of lives. Their pledge, and the commitments of other countries, are helping to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. 
283	@BillGates	a	If we want to give our kids the best chance possible to succeed after high school, we need more teachers like @_MrHand: https://t.co/GxtYKlRH0u 
284	@BillGates	a	Today marks three years since Nigeria's last wild poliovirus case. This progress wouldn’t have been possible without the bravery of the young women who volunteer as polio vaccinators. 
285	@BillGates	a	Tomorrow is #WorldMosquitoDay, when we recognize all of our partners and grantees who are fighting against the world’s deadliest animal and the diseases it spreads: https://t.co/RlZ2PlXt7V 
286	@BillGates	a	I never really learned how to cook. I’m finally learning my way around the kitchen, though, thanks to Robert Hand: https://t.co/AJdkDB7fzE 
287	@BillGates	a	Four billion people are at risk from mosquito-borne diseases. We can get that number down to zero if we invest in new tools — like a set of techniques for genetically modifying mosquitoes — to complement the ones we already have. 
288	@BillGates	a	I learned a lot from Washington State Teacher of the Year @_MrHand about creating a classroom where kids want to be (and he taught me how to make BBQ chicken). 
289	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I are big fans of @DonorsChoose, and we were thrilled to learn that @WKamauBell is, too. Today, when you support teachers as they prepare to go back to school, your donation will get a 50% boost from our foundation: https://t.co/Klc2UIOcnw 
290	@BillGates	a	When teachers have the right tools, there’s no telling where it will take them. Today, when you give to @DonorsChoose, @gatesfoundation will boost your donation by 50%. I hope you’ll join us in supporting teachers. 
291	@BillGates	a	Being poor isn’t cheap. It’s hundreds of times more expensive to use charging stations than it is to charge a phone at home. That’s just one of the hidden costs of unreliable electricity: https://t.co/1RTxaL1chd 
292	@BillGates	a	Whenever I want to understand something better, I pick up a book. Here are some of the best ones I’ve read so far this year: https://t.co/Q9RFZW6uid #BookLoversDay 
293	@BillGates	a	There is no question that reliable electricity unlocks a better life for people. But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can: https://t.co/33sGjLspfT 
294	@BillGates	a	Think back to the last time you experienced a power outage. If you live in New York, you don’t have to think that far back! Now imagine what it would be like not to have access to electricity at all. Nearly one billion people face that reality every day. 
295	@BillGates	a	Five years ago, India was declared polio-free. This incredible milestone was made possible by the health workers, governments, partners, and donors who didn’t rest until every child was reached. I can’t wait to see what India achieves next. 
296	@BillGates	a	What if we really are all in this together? In this fascinating book, @NAChristakis explains why and how humans evolved to work together: https://t.co/SkaMiLYjkn 
297	@BillGates	a	10 breakthrough technologies that could help us feed the world and fight climate change at the same time. 
298	@BillGates	a	It's hard to overstate how important finding a better diagnostic is for fighting #Alzheimers. That’s why I’m investing in new ideas for easier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease. 
299	@BillGates	a	If you read one article about climate change this week, check out this one from @voxdotcom. Government support for energy R&amp;D is one of the best opportunities to fight climate change. 
300	@BillGates	a	Are our similarities powerful enough to overcome our differences? “Blueprint” is an optimistic (and terrific) book that explores why humans have evolved to work together and cooperate. 
301	@BillGates	a	I usually wait until the end of the year to share good news that you might have missed, but I couldn’t resist sharing this list from @PositiveNewsUK (check out #14!). Which story has inspired you the most so far this year? 
302	@BillGates	a	Can you imagine an aircraft engine in your car? The @ARPAE Summit is one of the coolest places to learn about new energy tech. The @btenergy team came back with lots of new ideas and insights from this year’s event. 
303	@BillGates	a	The people who will suffer most from climate change are the ones least responsible for it. Here’s how we can help them: https://t.co/S32e1ljJru 
304	@BillGates	a	This is something I would have loved as a kid: @MicrosoftStore is hosting a series of free Camp Know Where events across the country. If your kids love science (and @Stranger_Things), I encourage you to check them out. 
305	@BillGates	a	What political and economic changes are needed to address climate change? If you’re between 16 and 25 years old, share your idea with @TheEconomist. I look forward to reading the winning entry! #OpenFuture 
306	@BillGates	a	Last year @GatesUS invested $92 million in networks of schools that are working together to improve student outcomes. Here’s an update on the progress we’ve made in the first year of the program – and what’s next: https://t.co/pjkgxeZq3z 
307	@BillGates	a	I recently wrote about how people with tech skills can find fascinating problems to work on in global health and development. I was excited to come across this @techreview article about African machine learning researchers who are already doing just that. 
308	@BillGates	a	“Fathers who help unlock their daughter’s potential, standing up for their rights and raising them to believe they have them, bring prosperity and happiness to their entire families.” I recommend reading this essay from @ZiauddinY about @Malala. #MalalaDay 
309	@BillGates	a	Nearly one billion malaria cases have been prevented since 2000, but infection rates have plateaued or even increased in some areas. @axios explains how we can #StepUptheFight and end the disease for good. 
310	@BillGates	a	Can we feed 10 billion people? I’m optimistic that we can if we invest in research that will help poor farmers adapt to climate change. 
311	@BillGates	a	Nuclear power is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world — but its growth is slowing down. This important @IEA report outlines how countries can support existing reactors and advance nuclear innovation. 
312	@BillGates	a	I wish I had understood much earlier in my career what true inequity looks like and how to fight it. That’s why I’m inspired by the story of William Wu, an engineer who started using his tech skills to fight inequity much sooner than I did: https://t.co/qEDOk3kVEo 
313	@BillGates	a	This is the teletype that brought Paul Allen and me together. And I’m so glad that it did. Paul was one of the most thoughtful, brilliant, and curious people I’ve ever met: https://t.co/CNw9gc5Xh7 
314	@BillGates	a	More people are getting their electricity from renewable sources that ever before. Here’s how we can build on the progress we’ve made: https://t.co/ftMb24y6sd 
315	@BillGates	a	Today’s commitment by @theresa_may to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB and malaria will help save millions of lives. @GlobalFund is one of the best investments the world can make in the years ahead: 
316	@BillGates	a	My friendship with Paul Allen changed my life. I loved sharing some of my favorite stories about him (and a few old photos!) at the Forbes Philanthropy Summit yesterday: https://t.co/3i6SFNg9q4 
317	@BillGates	a	Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery. I’m excited that more inventors and investors are being attracted to the quest to build a better one. 
318	@BillGates	a	It’s great to see such early support from Japan in re-committing to the @GlobalFund. The support of @AbeShinzo and the Japanese people will help the world #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria. 
319	@BillGates	a	I’m excited about the progress we’re making toward understanding Alzheimer’s. For the first time, @MIT researchers have completed an analysis of the genes that are expressed in individual brain cells of Alzheimer’s patients. 
320	@BillGates	a	I’m excited to see such incredible leadership from @EmmanuelMacron and the people of France towards @GlobalFund. If more countries #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria, we can save 16 million lives. 
321	@BillGates	a	I learned what’s possible in agriculture from studying a remarkable scientist named Norman Borlaug. If you’re curious about Borlaug and his breakthroughs, I recommend this article and a book called “The Man Who Fed the World.” 
322	@BillGates	a	If you have the willingness to learn about a problem and the talent to help solve it, you can make a remarkable difference in the world. Just ask former NASA engineer William Wu: https://t.co/YDvisdSjki 
323	@BillGates	a	I encourage software developers, inventors, and scientists to consider how they can use their skills to fight inequity. 
324	@BillGates	a	When @goodreads asked me to share my top summer reading recommendations, it was hard to narrow down the list. 
325	@BillGates	a	Fighting disease is like fighting fire. It’s not enough to put out most of it — you have to get it all. @Rotary’s generous pledge to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will help us extinguish this terrible disease for good. 
326	@BillGates	a	The fight against malaria is one of the greatest success stories in global health — but progress has slowed in recent years. To regain momentum, we must work together to combat drug and insecticide resistance. 
327	@BillGates	a	I was moved by this story: Bob’s daughter has Down syndrome, which puts her at a higher risk for dementia. Motivated by her condition and his love of science, he volunteered for an #Alzheimers clinical trial. 
328	@BillGates	a	Our foundation’s Day of Caring is one of my dad’s favorite days of the year. I know he can’t wait to hear what our employees learn from our partners this year. 
329	@BillGates	a	I’m always amazed by the disconnect between what we see in the news and the reality of the world around us. As my late friend Hans Rosling would say, we must fight the fear instinct that distorts our perspective: https://t.co/uQRofM4q2u 
330	@BillGates	a	Thank you for being a friend, Warren: https://t.co/4hhwUvkGox #BestFriendsDay 
331	@BillGates	a	I’m thrilled about the elimination of malaria from Algeria and Argentina. This news gives me hope that we’ll one day get rid of the disease forever. 
332	@BillGates	a	David Letterman’s newest season of #MyNextGuest has a lot of fascinating guests, but there’s one clear standout for me. Check out @melindagates's terrific interview on @netflix: https://t.co/vzS70LBNyj 
333	@BillGates	a	Patience: it's a valuable skill for investing and for training new employees at Dairy Queen. 
334	@BillGates	a	Warren and I recently picked up a @DairyQueen shift. I think I may have been a quicker study in the Blizzard department, but watch the video below and judge for yourself: https://t.co/BJc1nV4kpa 
335	@BillGates	a	A powerful call to action from @angienguku on the eve of #WD2019. @melindagates and I are impatient for every mother to have access to high-quality maternal care. 
336	@BillGates	a	If you’re working on digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, I encourage you to apply for the next round of funding on the Diagnostics Accelerator website: https://t.co/pQP0E0x8oO 
337	@BillGates	a	Congratulations to the first round of award recipients from @TheADDF’s Diagnostics Accelerator. Your ideas are getting us closer to a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease. 
338	@BillGates	a	Identifying candidates for clinical trials more quickly is essential in the fight against Alzheimer’s. That’s why I’m excited about reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools like blood tests. 
339	@BillGates	a	I recently sat down with one of my favorite authors, Jared Diamond. His perspective on political polarization really caught my attention: https://t.co/cfPHMmYgcw 
340	@BillGates	a	Breakthrough Energy Ventures – Europe will be a catalyst for innovative solutions to fight climate change. We have the resources to make a meaningful difference and the flexibility to move quickly. That’s a rare and powerful combination. 
341	@BillGates	a	We need the collective effort of governments, individuals, and the private sector to tackle climate change. I’m excited about Canada’s new partnership with @btenergy. #CEMMI2019 
342	@BillGates	a	I can’t recommend these books highly enough: https://t.co/h9J71vWAcz 
343	@BillGates	a	Last year I recommended “Bad Blood,” which is about the rise and fall of Theranos. This year I’m recommending “Nine Pints,” another book about blood that you won’t want to put down. 
344	@BillGates	a	I’m a big fan of everything Jared Diamond has written, and his latest book, “Upheaval,” is no exception. You can download a free chapter here: https://t.co/aeB13snhM3 
345	@BillGates	a	This #RedNoseDay, I’m swapping out my usual summer books for something a little different. Learn how you can help end child poverty, one red nose at a time: https://t.co/8z5vwVqiCB 
346	@BillGates	a	Whether you’re a political leader or just an armchair historian, you’ll learn a lot from @BeschlossDC's book “Presidents of War.” 
347	@BillGates	a	This book will take you on a trip you’ll never forget: https://t.co/l4IvTS9AHD 
348	@BillGates	a	Looking for a summer read? You can’t go wrong with one of these great books: 
349	@BillGates	a	This is great news: wind and solar power generation is expanding at record rates, allowing more people to get their electricity from renewable sources than ever before. Here’s how we can move even faster towards a zero-carbon future: https://t.co/dtpxiKGHSb 
350	@BillGates	a	Together, we can achieve what @Rotary first envisioned: a world where no child will be struck with polio ever again. This weekend, I was honored to thank @RotaryRassin and other Rotarians in person for their dedication to the fight against polio. 
351	@BillGates	a	Nearly every job created since the last recession has gone to someone with a post-high school education. But which degrees and programs provide the greatest value? Our foundation is launching a new commission to find out: https://t.co/382oqYQ161 
352	@BillGates	a	A college degree is the surest path to a healthy, rewarding life and career. But which degrees and programs provide the greatest value to students? Our foundation CEO @SueDHellmann is co-chairing a new commission to get that data into the hands of more families. 
353	@BillGates	a	Everyone at the @gatesfoundation looks forward to days when our trustee Warren is on campus. @melindagates and I couldn’t ask for a better champion for our employees, partners, and grantees. 
354	@BillGates	a	It is surprisingly hard to store renewable energy. Here are three startups I’m excited about that are tackling this challenge: https://t.co/ilUAEa5TVJ 
355	@BillGates	a	It’s easy to be overwhelmed by climate change and what to do about it. I recently wrote about why I’m optimistic we can prevent the worst from happening: https://t.co/J4sntwJFRO 
356	@BillGates	a	A fascinating discussion with computer scientist @drfeifei, historian @harari_yuval, and journalist @nxthompson on the future of AI. 
357	@BillGates	a	My mom was one of the most generous people I’ve ever known. If I grew up #WithoutMom, I wouldn’t be the man I am today. Join the fight against preventable maternal deaths so that no child grows up without a mother. 
358	@BillGates	a	All my life I’ve been surrounded by remarkable women. And I was moved when Melinda decided to write about two of them — my mother and my grandmother — in her new book, The #MomentofLift. Happy #MotherDay to all the amazing mothers out there! 
359	@BillGates	a	This fascinating #dataviz looks at how the global population pyramid is changing. With the right investments in health and education, young people at the bottom of the pyramid will drive tremendous growth and innovation. 
360	@BillGates	a	I was touched when Melinda asked me to introduce her at her #MomentofLift book tour stop in Seattle tonight. I wanted to do right by her but wasn’t sure what the best approach was -- so I turned to someone with some expertise in this area… 
361	@BillGates	a	2018 National Teacher of the Year @MandyRheaWrites told me about the remarkable resilience of her students. I was inspired by their stories and Mandy’s ability to connect with them: https://t.co/rMLfrtVrHv #ThankATeacher 
362	@BillGates	a	I really enjoyed spending time with 2017 WA State Teacher of the Year @farmtableteach. She showed me a neat lesson that can be used to teach science and engineering to students as young as 5 years old: https://t.co/iBbGi2Iu18 #ThankATeacher 
363	@BillGates	a	For Teacher Appreciation Week, I’ll be highlighting some of the most impactful lessons I’ve learned from educators in my home state. 2019 WA State Teacher of the Year @_MrHand showed me how he could build lesson plans that resonate with every student. #ThankATeacher 
364	@BillGates	a	I’ve learned a lot from the career of this real-life Sherlock Holmes: https://t.co/LhCRp52KgN 
365	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I love meeting with people who are trying to change the world. Here are four of the people who inspired Melinda when she set out to write her new book, The #MomentofLift. 
366	@BillGates	a	What does a “dirt detective” do for a living? I’m eager to watch this talk from soil scientist Asmeret Asefaw Berhe about how we can use soil to fight climate change. @TEDTalks 
367	@BillGates	a	A few months ago, Fred contributed a piece to my blog which outlined why educating the next generation of African leaders will be so important. 
368	@BillGates	a	By the end of the century, almost half of the young people in the world will be in sub-Saharan Africa. 
369	@BillGates	a	.@FredSwaniker has an ambitious plan to unlock the talents of young Africans. I was thrilled to see him featured in the latest issue of #TIME100. 
370	@BillGates	a	It’s hard for me to overstate how brave people who fight outbreaks are. They face a near-impossible task with grace under pressure: https://t.co/dZi32udwDm 
371	@BillGates	a	Congratulations @SueDHellmann on your 5th anniversary @gatesfoundation. Your leadership on some of the world’s toughest challenges inspires me. 
372	@BillGates	a	The world’s historic progress to #endpolio would not be possible without the strong commitment of partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE: https://t.co/MedY3Ta6vx 
373	@BillGates	a	If you enjoyed the @Avengers this weekend, I think you’ll be inspired by these real-life heroes: https://t.co/51u5y77EqZ 
374	@BillGates	a	It’s amazing to think about the creative ways we’ve delivered vaccines over the years (even by dog sled, when necessary). Today, a startup called Zipline is even using delivery drones to reach the most remote parts of the world. 
375	@BillGates	a	The promise and perils of gene-editing might be the most important public debate we haven’t been having widely enough. I encourage you to read up on it whenever you have a chance. This @TheEconomist piece is a great place to start. 
376	@BillGates	a	One of my favorite authors, @sapinker, co-wrote a piece about why nuclear power is so important in fighting climate change. It’s worth reading. 
377	@BillGates	a	Deaths from malaria have dropped 42% since 2000. I’m as optimistic as ever that we can get to zero deaths in our generation: https://t.co/7PGDJv9PWG #WorldMalariaDay 
378	@BillGates	a	Stories like this one from Kenya remind me of why Melinda and I started our foundation. I'm optimistic we will continue to make progress towards the day that no child dies from a preventable disease. #VaccinesWork 
379	@BillGates	a	Melinda’s new book, The #MomentofLift, is out today: 
380	@BillGates	a	On #EarthDay, I’m inspired by the inventors who are tackling climate change and all the people who are supporting their work. I can’t wait to share their progress with you throughout the year. 
381	@BillGates	a	Melinda’s new book The #MomentofLift is an urgent call to action. I’ll commit to the lift by working to ensure that we collect better data about women’s lives and livelihoods. 
382	@BillGates	a	Gene drive is a technique where you give a few mosquitoes an edited gene and it drives itself into all their offspring. It could one day help us defeat diseases like malaria: https://t.co/8rlIYXbWSN 
383	@BillGates	a	Less than a century ago, families everywhere lived in fear of a mosquito bite. Now 75% of all malaria cases occur in just 15 countries. The partners fighting this disease won’t rest until we’ve reached every case of malaria, while saving as many lives as possible along the way. 
384	@BillGates	a	3: Which of the following factors affect the spread of malaria? The answer is in my latest blog post: 
385	@BillGates	a	2: What kind of pathogen causes malaria? Find the answer here: 
386	@BillGates	a	Here’s one reason why I really, really hate mosquitoes: https://t.co/DDG0kG692T #MosquitoWeek 
387	@BillGates	a	I’ve been fascinated by Leonardo da Vinci for decades. Although he died 500 years ago, there’s still so much to learn from his remarkable life: https://t.co/mLf6AU0QLX 
388	@BillGates	a	Precision maps are bringing us closer to the day when malaria is gone forever. 
389	@BillGates	a	Why I would rather encounter a shark in the wild than a mosquito: https://t.co/6CrnkJ6f31 #MosquitoWeek 
390	@BillGates	a	I’m proud that @Microsoft is one of the many companies taking action to fight climate change and excited about its leadership in using AI to accelerate progress on these challenges. 
391	@BillGates	a	To kick off #MosquitoWeek, I wrote about the world’s deadliest shapeshifter (and what scientists are learning about how to beat it). 
392	@BillGates	a	There’s an epic scene at the end where Spock has to figure out which one is the impostor. 
393	@BillGates	a	They're back... #MosquitoWeek 
394	@BillGates	a	Young Africans will shape the future of not just their own communities but the entire world. 
395	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I were honored to join President Bush and Laura Bush @TheBushCenter. Their leadership of programs like @PEPFAR has helped save millions of lives around the world. 
396	@BillGates	a	I would say this even if I weren’t married to the author: @melindagates’s new book “The Moment of Lift” is a terrific read. You can see for yourself by downloading a free excerpt: https://t.co/BdQoC5LiIv 
397	@BillGates	a	I’ve learned so much from Melinda over the years and I’m delighted she is now sharing her insights with the rest of the world: https://t.co/FPw5nIAoGm 
398	@BillGates	a	I’ve recommended a lot of books over the years, but The #MomentofLift is particularly special to me… 
399	@BillGates	a	.@melindagates is the most important person in my life: an amazing partner, wife, mother, and friend (and now accomplished author!). Her new book is a terrific read that will leave you feeling enlightened and inspired: https://t.co/iCWebQwSH1 
400	@BillGates	a	Of the many uses for AI, I’m particularly excited about how it can help improve the lives of the world’s poorest. 
401	@BillGates	a	In the future, identifying your risk of developing Alzheimer’s could be as simple as speaking into an app on your phone: https://t.co/6BJKeQkjUk 
402	@BillGates	a	When Paul and I founded @Microsoft together, we were confident that computers would change the world. But we never could have imagined how much fun we would have along the way. 
403	@BillGates	a	Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings is one of the five biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. I love that architects are looking to nature to find solutions. 
404	@BillGates	a	Most Americans want to know if they will get Alzheimer’s as early as possible. That’s an important insight for scientists as they work to improve diagnostic tools. 
405	@BillGates	a	Thanks to major breakthroughs over the last several years, we’re closer than ever to having a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use way to diagnose Alzheimer’s. 
406	@BillGates	a	This surprised me: there’s more carbon in soil than in the atmosphere and all plant life combined. Here’s what that means for how we fight climate change: https://t.co/i1vPN7G3Sn 
407	@BillGates	a	Pivot Bio has developed an alternative to synthetic fertilizer that could help transform farming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions: https://t.co/3keIlFe2MR 
408	@BillGates	a	Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I can’t overstate how important this is. 
409	@BillGates	a	We need to reach zero net emissions from every sector of the economy including agriculture (which, along with forestry, and land use, is responsible for almost as much greenhouse gas emissions as electricity). 
410	@BillGates	a	Most discussions about fighting climate change focus on electricity and the need for renewable energy. De-carbonizing the way we generate electricity would be a huge step, but it won’t be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
411	@BillGates	a	Five years ago, India was declared poliofree. Whenever someone asks me how they did it, I tell them about one of the country’s lowest castes: the Musahar. https://t.co/X6AZTigffl 
412	@BillGates	a	I’m inspired by Azim Premji’s continued commitment to philanthropy. His latest contribution will make a tremendous impact. 
413	@BillGates	a	Thanks to the incredible work of goat nurses, thousands of women in India have an opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of poverty: https://t.co/KzLMfLz5Um 
414	@BillGates	a	.@SueDHellmann recently sat down with @CDCFound to talk about how our foundation measures the impact of our partners and grantees. It’s worth a listen: https://t.co/DJkkrX2Ytj 
415	@BillGates	a	Meet the goat nurses, an incredible team of health workers who help women gain financial independence by raising healthier goats. 
416	@BillGates	a	2019 marks 150 years since the creation of the periodic table. Whenever people visit my office, I like to show them my favorite version. It’s made out of samples of each element, and reminds me every day of why I’m so fascinated by science and technology: https://t.co/d5sYO9ehUE 
417	@BillGates	a	If you believe innovation is for everyone, then I have a list for you: 10 challenges that the world needs your ideas to help solve. 
418	@BillGates	a	Diversity is good for innovation. This is a great conversation between @robotsmarts and @timnitGebru on the importance of representation and female leadership in tech. 
419	@BillGates	a	If you want to discover what makes a school great, there’s no substitute for spending time in the classroom. I learned a lot from the students and teachers at this Chicago school: https://t.co/hN6zJEnjQW 
420	@BillGates	a	Medical advances should be available to everyone who needs them. That’s why I’m excited about an inexpensive blood test that could help doctors predict if a baby will be born prematurely. This information would undoubtedly save lives. 
421	@BillGates	a	It’s great to see leaders in Washington talking about accelerating energy innovation to fight climate change. This op-ed from @lisamurkowski and @Sen_JoeManchin is worth reading. 
422	@BillGates	a	I was lucky to be a young person when the digital revolution was just getting under way, and my Microsoft colleagues and I had the chance to help shape it. Celebrating #Web30 leaves me feeling nostalgic about 1995. 
423	@BillGates	a	Behind every progress report is a student story. As Yusef — a senior at North-Grand High School in Chicago — told me, he is “seeing himself clearly” in ways he couldn’t before thanks to better data about his progress: https://t.co/zlGlEZPZPE 
424	@BillGates	a	When I visited Ethiopia last month, I was impressed by the government’s commitment to gender equality. Ethiopian President @SahleWorkZewde explains why lifting up women benefits everyone. 
425	@BillGates	a	Melinda’s work on behalf of women and girls inspires me every day. I love this video she made for #IWD2019 
426	@BillGates	a	Tomorrow is #IWD2019 — a day when we celebrate the progress made by and for women. To celebrate, @melindagates is sharing a chapter from her new book, “The Moment of Lift,” about the lessons she’s learned from women around the world. 
427	@BillGates	a	I recently visited a high school that has gone from one of Chicago’s worst to one of its best: https://t.co/1GaU7pLcSs 
428	@BillGates	a	By embracing data, research, and community, schools have an opportunity to help students succeed in high school, college, and beyond. 
429	@BillGates	a	Congrats on your 100th title @rogerfederer! Looking forward to seeing you soon. 
430	@BillGates	a	I had a great time chatting with a fellow tech enthusiast, @MKBHD. We talked about electric cars, AI, and how tech can give back. 
431	@BillGates	a	I was excited when I thought @MarkRober brought me a hamburger. Turns out it was a bottle of swamp water… 
432	@BillGates	a	Reading is my favorite way to learn about a new subject. Here are 10 books that have shaped how I’m thinking about technology today. 
433	@BillGates	a	Everything I’ve learned about Leonardo da Vinci leads me to believe he was one of the most innovative thinkers ever. Here’s what he’s taught me about art, optimism, and innovation. 
434	@BillGates	a	I’m a big fan of the MIT @techreview's annual list of breakthrough technologies — so when they asked me to choose this year’s list, I jumped at the chance.

456	@BillGates	a	In 2009, my friend @NandanNilekani was tapped by the government of India to turn its vision for a digital ID system into a reality. A decade later, nearly all of India’s 1.3 billion residents are enrolled in this impressive program: https://t.co/2YUxCRwXPE 
457	@BillGates	a	I enjoyed serving as @TIME first-ever guest editor last year, and I was excited when I heard that @ava would be taking the helm this year. Congrats, Ava, on a great issue highlighting the power of “art and optimism.” 
458	@BillGates	a	Energy innovation is the best investment we can make to prevent the worst effects of climate change. @btenergy just released a new report with @ErnestMoniz and @DanielYergin outlining near-term actions to bring more clean energy technologies to market. 
459	@BillGates	a	Nandan Nilekani is one of India's leading technology entrepreneurs. He and I are both optimistic about the potential of secure digital ID systems to improve people’s lives: https://t.co/JICcHOgdJ2 
460	@BillGates	a	When @melindagates and I started our foundation, we knew our investments would be high-risk, high-reward. Melinda explains why the returns have been greater than we ever could have imagined. 
461	@BillGates	a	One billion people don’t have an official proof of identity. One of India’s leading technology entrepreneurs is working to change that: https://t.co/dQDp2kKQ7O 
462	@BillGates	a	Some good news in the Ebola fight: nearly 64,000 vaccine doses have been administered so far. Great partnership between @gavi, @WHO, and @Merck. 
463	@BillGates	a	Global health organizations turned a $10 billion investment into $200 billion in benefits. You can’t beat that deal: https://t.co/abKrtagQo7

465	@BillGates	a	It’s hard to beat this #10YearChallenge: https://t.co/HZqjeE2Q8t 
466	@BillGates	a	I look at a lot of global health data, and one trend stands above the rest: Global health groups like @gavi, @GlobalFund, GPEI and @theGFF are some of the best investments the world can make. 
467	@BillGates	a	Global health organizations are the best investments that Melinda and I have ever made. I look forward to continue working with you to advocate for health financing, @DrTedros.

470	@BillGates	a	Martin Luther King Jr. inspired civil rights legend @repjohnlewis to get in “good trouble.” On #MLKDay, here’s the congressman’s advice for young people. 
471	@BillGates	a	I saw two positive trends in Alzheimer’s research in 2018: fresh ideas and better data. Here’s how we can make even more progress in 2019. 
472	@BillGates	a	This is one of my favorite infographics. A lot of people underestimate just how much life has improved over the last two centuries: https://t.co/djavT7MaW9 
473	@BillGates	a	You can’t beat this ROI. 
474	@BillGates	a	If we’re going to win the fight against poverty, we have to be able to reach the world’s poorest people. Drones could be a powerful tool in reaching the last mile. 
475	@BillGates	a	Congratulations to the Indian government on the first 100 days of @AyushmanNHA. It’s great to see how many people have been reached by the program so far. @PMOIndia 
476	@BillGates	a	The world needs energy breakthroughs that improve people’s lives without contributing to climate change. As @IEA highlights in its latest report, governments have an incredible opportunity to shape the future of energy.

478	@BillGates	a	Good news you might have missed in 2018. 
479	@BillGates	a	When you hear the word “robot,” what comes to mind? At Harvard, I saw some surprising inventions that challenge our popular images of robots: https://t.co/b0vT9UZuU7 
480	@BillGates	a	There's no question that it was a tough year for a lot of people. But @NickKristof makes a convincing case for why 2018 was actually the best year in human history. 
481	@BillGates	a	I can’t think of a better person to bring these stories to light. Congratulations, @Malala. 
482	@BillGates	a	I recently visited @Harvard to learn more about robotics research. It was exciting to speak with the many young people drawn to this rapidly growing field.

484	@BillGates	a	When I was in my 20s, my year in review would amount to just one question: Is Microsoft software making the personal-computing dream come true? These are the questions I’m asking myself today: https://t.co/fuBOYurIP5 #TBT 
485	@BillGates	a	Happy anniversary, @melindagates. I can’t wait to spend 25 more years laughing together. 
486	@BillGates	a	Gene editing might be the most important public debate we’re not having right now. Read up on it whenever you have a chance. Even better, read @DrSidMukherjee’s “The Gene.” 
487	@BillGates	a	Some people think we have all the clean-energy sources we need to stop climate change. But we don’t. As I wrote earlier this year, the world needs to be working on lots of solutions to stop climate change. 
488	@BillGates	a	1/ What a year. If you’re anything like me, you’re taking stock of your work and your life, and wondering where all the time went. Here are a few of my thoughts as 2018 wraps up.

492	@BillGates	a	This year I asked my Secret Santa (one of my favorite @reddit traditions) to give to a cause that matters to them. My Santa is helping a young girl continue her education in a refugee camp through @theIRC: https://t.co/wtTunWwJaW 
493	@BillGates	a	New data. New insights. New discoveries. These are just a few of the reasons why @gatesfoundation kept me optimistic in 2018: https://t.co/yIG2l8qhDf 
494	@BillGates	a	This one-of-a-kind device brings you closer than ever to one of history’s greatest thinkers: https://t.co/PY0l9skp3B 
495	@BillGates	a	I’m a fan of everything @harari_yuval has written, and his latest book is no exception. 
496	@BillGates	a	I am an optimist. For me that means that I’m inspired to look for people making progress, and to help spread that progress as widely as possible. Here are some of those areas. 
497	@BillGates	a	Tara Westover didn’t step foot in a classroom until she was 17. At 32, she’s written one of the best books of the year. I was thrilled to sit down with her to talk about her remarkable life: https://t.co/r1aQWLyTWx 
498	@BillGates	a	I often talk about how much progress we’ve made in health and energy. Turns out, the same thing can be said about innovation in sports: 
499	@BillGates	a	This book is a must read for anyone interested in AI, machine learning, and machine vision. 
500	@BillGates	a	Since 2000, @gavi has vaccinated 700 million children, saving more than 10 million lives. That kind of progress is thanks to the many Gavi alliance partners, including the UAE. #vaccineswork 
501	@BillGates	a	When it comes to meditation, @andypuddicombe turned me from a skeptic to a believer. 
502	@BillGates	a	Good news in the fight against TB: More and more South Africans are surviving the disease: https://t.co/ROxM7LZYGH 
503	@BillGates	a	Melinda explains why the next great programmer won’t look anything like me (which is good for them, and for the world). 
504	@BillGates	a	My kids tease me for being the most competitive person in our family. My latest challenge? A game called “Guess the Philosopher” with @tarawestover: https://t.co/7pHSK0bZE8 
505	@BillGates	a	It’s no wonder Hollywood is turning this book into a movie. I couldn’t put it down. 
506	@BillGates	a	Brilliant engineers and scientists around the world are working hard to get the next generation of toilets off the ground. And then there is Ronny Chieng... 
507	@BillGates	a	Everyone could use a few more books in their lives. You can’t go wrong with one of these five. 
508	@BillGates	a	Five of the books I couldn’t put down in 2018: https://t.co/UyDnOLSBQl 
509	@BillGates	a	One of my favorite authors, @sapinker, sums up why history is an imperfect guide for progress: “If history is about all the wars, all the disasters, you’re missing all this incremental improvement that can only be ascertained through data.” 
510	@BillGates	a	Tuberculosis has haunted humanity for millennia—it’s even been found in Egyptian mummies. This is the story of a doctor on the frontlines of the fight against one of the world’s oldest diseases: https://t.co/PJZLdyXsyA 
511	@BillGates	a	If you’re a science and data nerd like me, you may be interested in ‘Alice and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire’ and ‘The Prime Number Conspiracy’ from @QuantaMagazine and @7homaslin. 
512	@BillGates	a	Thanks to brilliant scientists in South Africa and around the world, there are signs of hope in the fight against TB. 
513	@BillGates	a	Before we got married, Melinda and I talked about how we would give back. We agreed that, once you’ve taken care of your family, the best use of extra wealth is to help make the world a better place. Join us in one of our favorite traditions https://t.co/tlrxu6FYjQ #GivingTuesday 
514	@BillGates	a	Last week I wrote about why I enjoy watching the @HBO series “Silicon Valley.” Here are six more shows worth catching up on. 
515	@BillGates	a	Can we grow enough food to feed the world? Agricultural transformation is at the heart of reducing poverty and creating prosperity: https://t.co/YYRehcfd88 
516	@BillGates	a	Considering the impact Silicon Valley has on our lives, I’m surprised how rarely pop culture gets it right. To understand how it works today, you should watch @SiliconHBO. Personally, I identify most with Richard Hendricks: https://t.co/EsiglR37Bo 
517	@BillGates	a	These six toilets could change the world: https://t.co/4ZXqwpQKxw #WorldToiletDay 
518	@BillGates	a	The future is bright for the world’s poorest farmers because of innovative companies like @myAgroFarms: https://t.co/OTckufEyN8 
519	@BillGates	a	I’ve been impressed by @CapriaVC’s work over the last several years and applaud @VulcanInc's investment in the firm. 
520	@BillGates	a	Well said, @MaxCRoser. Being an optimist doesn’t mean you ignore tragedy. 
521	@BillGates	a	Farm yields in many parts of Africa are just a fifth of those in the United States. Innovations in agriculture will make it possible for poor farmers to increase their yields: https://t.co/oW7hMmOwd7 
522	@BillGates	a	Whenever I travel for the foundation, the farmers I meet talk about one thing that holds them back: they can’t save their money. @myAgroFarms is one of the companies working on creative solutions to this problem. 
523	@BillGates	a	I just shared the stage with a beaker of poop in China. Seriously. Here's why: https://t.co/9pH7NjRk4L 
524	@BillGates	a	The toilet hasn’t really changed in more than a century. But a new generation of technology could save millions of lives. 
525	@BillGates	a	There are few things I love talking about more than toilets. 
526	@BillGates	a	Climate change may be the toughest problem humanity has ever faced — but it's solvable. Washington has a unique opportunity to lead the way as a hub for innovation on clean energy. I urge you to vote yes on 1631. Ballots must be in the mail by Tuesday. 
527	@BillGates	a	A compelling look at how advocates and energy sector leaders are working together to tackle the real drivers of climate change. 
528	@BillGates	a	.@ava I can’t wait to see which stories you shine a light on in the next @TIME Optimist issue. I was thrilled to contribute. 
529	@BillGates	a	I’m at @Stanford today to talk about energy innovation. To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to get to zero net greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy within 50 years. Here’s how we can do it: https://t.co/G3iCIQL0lA #StanfordGEF 
530	@BillGates	a	Thailand’s “Mr. Condom” has taught people that there is no reason to be shy about talking about sexual health: https://t.co/BQGQXYYiK9 
531	@BillGates	a	Can we end extreme poverty? I believe we can get close. 
532	@BillGates	a	Technology is not an end in itself. What matters is how we use it to enhance people’s opportunities.  As @melindagates writes in @CNN,  that’s where the magic happens. 
533	@BillGates	a	In a country where most people were uneasy discussing sex, Mechai Viravaidya pushed the conversation out into the open. Thanks to his efforts, Thailand became one of the first countries to achieve a decline in HIV infections: https://t.co/aODfPs5Hcj 
534	@BillGates	a	When people in Thailand want a condom, they don’t call it a condom. Instead, they refer to it by the name of the man who taught them the importance of using one: https://t.co/RNQfVEqfSi 
535	@BillGates	a	Rwanda’s health system has become a model for other nations to follow. The country’s example should inspire all leaders to renew their commitments to primary health care. #Astana2018 
536	@BillGates	a	In his home country, “The Condom King” doesn’t need an introduction. Mechai Viravaidya’s extraordinary life and work in global health has helped improve the lives of millions of people in Thailand. 
537	@BillGates	a	A polio-free future is within reach. @TVAshleigh is hosting @Rotary’s #WorldPolioDay event to highlight the road ahead. Here’s how to tune-in now. 
538	@BillGates	a	We must take bold steps to end polio for good. Two of the leaders of in this effort, @RotaryRassin and @DrTedros, share what it will take to finish the job. #WorldPolioDay 
539	@BillGates	a	Few people tell stories as well as Melinda. Whenever she gets back from a trip, I always love hearing her talk about the places she went and the people she met. That’s one of the reasons why I’m excited about her new book. 
540	@BillGates	a	I try to visit India at least once a year, and every time I’m excited by something new that our foundation’s partners are working on. Here are a few notable updates from the @BMGFIndia team: https://t.co/L9z2UqzV4x #StrongerTogether 
541	@BillGates	a	Over the next year, I will be writing a lot about the effort to stop climate change. If you’re interested in a first look at what I’m reading and learning, join the Gates Notes community: https://t.co/h7yN0MoKF4 
542	@BillGates	a	In my home state, climate change is on the ballot. Here’s why I’m voting @Yeson1631 and why I’m encouraging my fellow Washingtonians to do the same. 
543	@BillGates	a	If all the cattle in the world joined together to start their own country, they would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Here are four more mind-blowing facts about climate change: https://t.co/xQoZN49JRQ 
544	@BillGates	a	We need the world’s brightest minds working on preventing the worst effects of climate change. I’m placing my bets in five key areas: https://t.co/GxDk4orF6D 
545	@BillGates	a	How many drivers would have to switch to electric cars to equal the annual emissions saved by replacing one coal power plant with a nuclear plant? Check your answer here and see if you can beat my score on the rest of this climate change quiz:

547	@BillGates	a	Paul deserved more time in life. He would have made the most of it. I will miss him tremendously. 
548	@BillGates	a	Creativity is how the younger generations will solve the world’s toughest problems. What will you create? #HourOfCode https://t.co/sUIuABm8Dm

550	@BillGates	a	Data can help farmers improve their yields and increase their incomes. A team of amazing researchers has developed a series of innovations that might one day put -changing information in the hands of even the poorest farmers: https://t.co/7Lgo9vncyg 
551	@BillGates	a	Of all the things I’ve discussed with @reidhoffman, one of the most thought-provoking might be blitzscaling. I’m glad Reid and @chrisyeh are sharing their insights on how to start and scale companies in their new book. 
552	@BillGates	a	I just shared a new list on @Likewise. These books make me optimistic about the world and help me understand the role of innovation in driving progress. 
553	@BillGates	a	The leadership of @narendramodi and the Indian government has played an important role in improving sanitation. Now is the time to build on the success of @swachhbharat.

555	@BillGates	a	Clean energy is one of the smartest investments our country can make. @ARPAE is leading the way with some exciting new investments in energy storage. 
556	@BillGates	a	Congratulations to @DenisMukwege on receiving this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. He and his team have helped more than 50,000 survivors of sexual violence rebuild their lives. 
557	@BillGates	a	Congratulations to @NadiaMuradBasee on receiving this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Melinda and I met Nadia at our Goalkeepers event last month, and were deeply moved by her humanity and compassion. 
558	@BillGates	a	Addressing climate change will require unprecedented innovation. I recently spent time with the world-class leadership team @btenergy, and I’m excited about the potential represented by these investments. 
559	@BillGates	a	Innovation can happen anywhere. In @TheEconomist, I argue that the best way to guarantee that everyone benefits from the next great idea is to maintain strong ties around the world. #OpenFuture 
560	@BillGates	a	.@Likewise is a great new app that makes it easy to save and share recommendations with friends and family. It’s been a lot of fun working with the team at Likewise, and I’m excited to see what you think of it.  
561	@BillGates	a	In his great book “Born A Crime,” @Trevornoah shared that his mother instilled in him a sense that his “ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered.” On @TheDailyShow, we talked about how we can ensure all young people believe in their power and potential: https://t.co/i4Aono48ak 
562	@BillGates	a	I am saddened to hear @PaulGAllen’s non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma has returned, but I share his optimism about the progress in medicine and admire his tenacity. He can beat this again.

566	@BillGates	a	Selase Kove-Seyram traveled the route that tomatoes take from farm to table. Along the way, he learned how food — and untapped human potential — could hold the key to his country’s success: https://t.co/QdAZmTBFlm #Goalkeepers18 
567	@BillGates	a	Can’t wait to catch up with @Trevornoah on @TheDailyShow tonight. 
568	@BillGates	a	We need energy breakthroughs that don’t contribute to climate change. Fellow innovators and investors: let’s do this. #OnePlanetSummit 
569	@BillGates	a	Young people like #Goalkeepers18 winners @NadiaMuradBasee, @AmikaGeorge, and Dysmus Kisilu aren’t just the leaders of tomorrow, they’re the leaders of today. I’m optimistic that global progress will continue—as long as we invest in young people.

589	@BillGates	a	22-year-old Rwandan Yvette Ishimwe is tackling her country’s water problem — and catching the attention of the Queen of England: https://t.co/rMhEuJo9pP 
590	@BillGates	a	The world has never been better, but not everyone has reaped the benefits. So it’s great to see Mackenzie &amp; @JeffBezos are launching two bold initiatives to help some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. I can’t wait to see the difference their work makes. 
591	@BillGates	a	Tenaw Muluye is helping his country grow — literally. The 25-year-old Ethiopian is an agricultural extension agent, one of 72,000 people teaching the country's farmers how to get the most out of their land and rise out of poverty. 
592	@BillGates	a	To have inclusive innovation, companies need to have diverse teams. That’s why I’m excited about @melindagates’s recent work on increasing pathways for women of color to enter tech. 
593	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I believe in the enormous potential of young people to drive progress and innovation. That's why we're focusing on the growing global youth population at #Goalkeepers18: https://t.co/6SPEP08B27 
594	@BillGates	a	What is the world’s youngest continent? Check your answer here: 
595	@BillGates	a	There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic that we can alter the course of Alzheimer’s. One of those reasons is bipartisan support for more @NIH funded research from forward-thinking leaders like @PattyMurray and @RoyBlunt. 
596	@BillGates	a	Sixty percent of Africans are under the age of 25. To see Africa through their eyes is to see a continent brimming with potential and opportunity: https://t.co/Sgxobv2iga 
597	@BillGates	a	I don’t always agree with @harari_yuval’s conclusions, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for his intellect and ambition as a writer. In @nytimesbooks, I review his new book, “21 Lessons for the 21st Century.” https://t.co/o7LTWk5Fud 
598	@BillGates	a	The Academy for Software Engineering, a public high school in New York, is using computer science concepts to inspire the next generation of innovators: https://t.co/B0wgyIfSSo 
599	@BillGates	a	A good report from @mitenergy on developing advanced nuclear reactors that are safe, nearly waste-free, and can help us fight climate change. 
600	@BillGates	a	Like all of his books, @harari_yuval’s “21 Lessons for the 21st Century” is focused on big questions. Harari has a lot of great answers—and a few I disagreed with in my review for @nytimesbooks. 
601	@BillGates	a	Computer science changed the course of my life. I recently visited a public high school that hopes to do the same thing for young people in New York: https://t.co/OSkHaiW5oL 
602	@BillGates	a	My friend Bono knows better than anyone what brings people together. In @faznet, he argues that European leaders need to appeal to people's hearts, not just their heads. 
603	@BillGates	a	.@afsenyc is doing great work preparing its students for life after high school, and for a lifetime of asking “how does it work?” and “how can I make it better?” 
604	@BillGates	a	When I wanted to learn something outside of school as a kid, cracking open my encyclopedia was the best I could do. Today, you just have to go online. For students headed back to school (and learners of all ages), here are my favorite learning hacks: https://t.co/lFo4aqI0WN 
605	@BillGates	a	SHOFCO co-founder @KennedyOdede is part of a new generation of African leaders working towards a better, brighter future for all young people. Congrats to Kennedy and @JessRPosner on receiving this year’s #HiltonPrize. 
606	@BillGates	a	I’m excited that our foundation is partnering with networks of schools. Here’s a short video explaining how we’re working to address gaps in opportunity and achievement between students. 
607	@BillGates	a	Income can often tell you more about how people live than location can. Whenever I visit a new place, I look for clues about which income level local families live on. These clues tell me a lot about the people there. 
608	@BillGates	a	From 2007 to 2015, the percentage of students on track to graduate from Chicago high schools rose from 61% to 85%. And four-year college enrollment rates went from 36% to 44%. Kenwood Academy is part of a network of schools driving that success. 
609	@BillGates	a	I wish every student could have a teacher like @MandyRheaWrites: https://t.co/5e2sC4I8Rs 
610	@BillGates	a	Great leadership by PM @theresa_may and her government. Foreign aid makes the UK more secure, prevents diseases, strengthens markets, and saves lives. #AidWorks 
611	@BillGates	a	Wind and solar won’t reach their potential until we vastly improve energy storage. There are some exciting companies working in this space (like @Bill_Gross and Andrea Pedretti’s Energy Vault), but we need even more innovation. 
612	@BillGates	a	Every student in America deserves a great education. 
613	@BillGates	a	.@MandyRheaWrites never expected to become National Teacher of the Year. But now that she is, her platform has helped more teachers get involved in education policy. 
614	@BillGates	a	Scientists announced last week that they have finally cracked the wheat genome. This is incredibly exciting news — and could have a positive impact on global food security: https://t.co/q3bM824h0q 
615	@BillGates	a	I recently sat down with a super-talented teacher named Mandy Manning. Her approach to helping immigrant and refugee teens succeed inspires me: https://t.co/mRLorlU4Zl 
616	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I are big fans of @DonorsChoose. Find a project that inspires you, and our foundation will give your donation a boost: https://t.co/PjWPRhiPVW 
617	@BillGates	a	National Teacher of the Year Mandy Manning is one of the most remarkable educators I have ever met. Her dedication to helping her students succeed, despite the odds, fills me with hope. 
618	@BillGates	a	I hate mosquitoes. The diseases they spread kill more than half a million people every year. In fact, mosquitoes kill more people in one day than sharks kill in 100 years: https://t.co/r81u9DDB2B #WorldMosquitoDay 
619	@BillGates	a	Kofi Annan was one of the great peacemakers of our time. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with him on many occasions. I’m sad to learn of his death. 
620	@BillGates	a	If you want to understand why this matters, I highly recommend the new book “Capitalism Without Capital” by @haskelecon and @stianwestlake. Here’s my review: 
621	@BillGates	a	At the time I was in college, this was basically how the global economy worked... 
622	@BillGates	a	My friend @PaulGAllen's @LivingComputers Museum &amp; Lab is a great place to learn about the tech revolution and what will come next. (It also has a working Altair 8800 – very cool) 
623	@BillGates	a	One in five students who plan to attend college don’t actually enroll. @GeorgiaStateU, a school I visited last year, used chatbots to reduce “summer melt” by 21%: https://t.co/OatrCs5Z54 
624	@BillGates	a	Congrats to @PearlJam on bringing together so many incredible partners and fans to fight homelessness in my hometown of Seattle. This is the kind of leadership we need more of in our city and beyond. #TheHomeShows 
625	@BillGates	a	In celebration of #BookLoversDay, here are five of my recent favorites. I think you’ll find there’s something for everyone: https://t.co/bvggr1jdas 
626	@BillGates	a	What fuels my optimism for the future? The data (because it tells a pretty remarkable story). 
627	@BillGates	a	The transformation of Rwanda’s health system has its roots in a very simple, but powerful belief: everyone deserves a shot at a healthy life, no matter their income, ethnic group, or where they call home. 
628	@BillGates	a	The world is facing some big challenges. I’m always thrilled to read about companies that find bold solutions. 
629	@BillGates	a	.@theGFF helps countries to develop low-cost, high-impact solutions to their pressing health problems. Kangaroo care is a great example of the interventions that they promote: https://t.co/H48rjYg1xk 
630	@BillGates	a	Great storytellers make complex topics easily accessible. @DrSidMukherjee and @KenBurns are two of the best I know, so I’m thrilled to see them working together. 
631	@BillGates	a	Sometimes life-saving interventions are remarkably simple: https://t.co/lMHKiZvqfP 
632	@BillGates	a	I talk a lot about new inventions that are saving lives around the world. But some breakthrough ideas don’t involve any technology at all.  
633	@BillGates	a	Excellent news. The success against Ebola in the DRC underscores the importance of investing to prepare for future outbreaks. 
634	@BillGates	a	I had a great conversation with @TeamGleason when I met him a few years ago.  I’m thrilled to see how @Microsoft has taken his challenge to use technology to empower others. 
635	@BillGates	a	I read @TheEconomist cover-to-cover because its content makes me think critically about the world. Its editors recently asked me a tough question: What is the one thing you'd do to create a more open world? See my answer below and share your answer here: https://t.co/snng1yCdRL 
636	@BillGates	a	Global health hero @rajpanjabi has dedicated his life to delivering basic health care to people who live beyond the reach of the health system: https://t.co/7pubJN7rRy 
637	@BillGates	a	We need more data sharing to increase our chances of finding an Alzheimer’s breakthrough. @NIH Dr. Richard Hodes is a leading figure in this field, and I learned a lot from reading his #AAIC18 remarks. 
638	@BillGates	a	We need a reliable, affordable, and accessible diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease. If you have a bold idea, I encourage you to apply for funding on the new Diagnostics Accelerator website: https://t.co/oNJH0CTgBc 
639	@BillGates	a	Alzheimer’s research is one of the most exciting frontiers of science. I’m optimistic we can alter the course of the disease if we make progress in five key areas, including the development of a better diagnostic: https://t.co/nChla7AA2T 
640	@BillGates	a	.@mariashriver the opportunity to learn from you and other members of the Alzheimer’s community has made me more optimistic than ever. 
641	@BillGates	a	Nelson Mandela was tireless in his pursuit of equality and justice for all. As we celebrate #Mandela100, let’s resolve to do everything we can to create the world he dreamed of. #MandelaDay 
642	@BillGates	a	I'm excited to share that my next investment in Alzheimer’s research is in a new fund from @TheADDF called Diagnostics Accelerator. I’m joining Leonard Lauder and other philanthropists in committing over $30M to develop a new way to diagnose Alzheimer’s. 
643	@BillGates	a	In Liberia, health workers travel far and wide to make sure no patient is out of reach: https://t.co/FsjLtR59CJ 
644	@BillGates	a	This is one of the rare times when I will share bad news: We’re still not ready for the next epidemic. (But we can be.) @edyong209 
645	@BillGates	a	“I want to change the world, and education is the best way to do it.” I support @khanacademy because of students like Anjali.

649	@BillGates	a	People are living longer, healthier lives than ever before. Here are three more signs the world is getting better: https://t.co/A4XTPphxYO 
650	@BillGates	a	Sierra Leone is doing better at beating back neglected tropical diseases than almost anywhere else on the continent: https://t.co/HBbmwNMUBH 
651	@BillGates	a	Is life getting better or worse? @MaxCRoser breaks down the data: https://t.co/Va08bZJda5 
652	@BillGates	a	This @TIME article on @NREL highlights just one example of the amazing work that goes on inside America’s national labs. 
653	@BillGates	a	This is a great example of how data is making it easier for researchers to identify novel targets and mechanisms for Alzheimer’s disease. We need more data sharing to increase our chances of finding a breakthrough. 
654	@BillGates	a	In January 1975, “Popular Electronics” featured the Altair 8800 on its cover. When my friend @PaulGAllen showed me that issue, I knew it would change our lives forever: https://t.co/Ul1Lg0c6aq 
655	@BillGates	a	Melinda and I are huge fans of “This is Us,” so it was a real treat for us to see @SterlingKBrown speak at our daughter Jenn’s graduation. His message to graduates was simple yet profound: “Do not be afraid to let your light shine.” 
656	@BillGates	a	#AI bots just beat humans at the video game Dota 2. That’s a big deal, because their victory required teamwork and collaboration – a huge milestone in advancing artificial intelligence. 
657	@BillGates	a	Fact #3: The world is making progress against extreme poverty. 
658	@BillGates	a	Fact #2: Since 1960, the number of children born per woman has fallen by half. 
659	@BillGates	a	Fact #1: Fewer children are dying before the age of 5. 
660	@BillGates	a	.@MaxCRoser is one of my favorite data nerds —and his website Our World in Data is a gold mine for impatient optimists like me. 
661	@BillGates	a	More than 25 years later, Warren and I have never run out of things to laugh about: https://t.co/YptnliWmOu 
662	@BillGates	a	If you’re interested in donating your time or resources but don’t know where to start, @TheEconomist recently highlighted one approach to giving that might give you some ideas. 
663	@BillGates	a	Earlier this month, the world lost one of the greatest vaccine creators of our time. Dr. Adel Mahmoud saved the lives of countless children. 
664	@BillGates	a	Tomorrow is the longest day of the year. While this is a cause for celebration for most of us, that may not be the case for people living with Alzheimer’s. All of us should be able to enjoy #TheLongestDay—and we need a breakthrough to fulfill that goal: https://t.co/SSKNbDH0N7 
665	@BillGates	a	My friend @WarrenBuffett plays a mean pinball. 
666	@BillGates	a	Keeping vaccines cold when you’re delivering them to the most remote places on earth is a tough challenge. I asked a group of brilliant inventors to help solve this problem – and they came up with two game-changing innovations: https://t.co/Hff5iGhjMU 
667	@BillGates	a	I’m excited about a revolutionary invention that’s already helping more kids get vaccinated: https://t.co/rwSmg8KHPj #vaccineswork

675	@BillGates	a	I’m thrilled that the Giving Pledge is becoming truly global. Melinda and I are pleased to welcome the addition of 14 more philanthropists from Canada, India, the UAE, and the U.S. 
676	@BillGates	a	Dear Class of 2018: Congratulations! To prepare you for the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, I have a gift for you (and yes, it’s a book): 
677	@BillGates	a	Dr. @denismukwege has witnessed unimaginable human suffering, and yet is one of the most optimistic people I’ve ever met. His story gives me hope: https://t.co/s26uaMZtAq 
678	@BillGates	a	Congratulations to @AminaJMohammed and @UN for the adoption today of bold new reforms. I look forward to continuing our work together toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals: 
679	@BillGates	a	I thought I knew pretty much everything there was to know about Abraham Lincoln. But I recently read a book that surprised me. 
680	@BillGates	a	I will never forget meeting @DenisMukwege. He and his staff have helped more than 50,000 survivors of sexual violence rebuild their lives. 
681	@BillGates	a	Looking forward to being back in Beijing for the New Economy Forum with @MikeBloomberg. I’m excited to explore how China can help drive innovation in health and development: https://t.co/2UxCPk3Uwh 
682	@BillGates	a	.@BigHistoryPro is my favorite course of all time. Its creator, @davidgchristian, has condensed the big history story into a terrific new book. 
683	@BillGates	a	I’m fortunate to own one of the 32 surviving journals of Leonardo da Vinci, so I was eager to read @WalterIsaacson’s new Leonardo biography. It did not disappoint: https://t.co/Ohl2oWUobV 
684	@BillGates	a	Progress is sometimes hard to see…but when you look at the facts, things are looking up: https://t.co/oHsL1UQESR

686	@BillGates	a	.@KatecBowler’s memoir belongs on the shelf alongside other great books about mortality, like “When Breath Becomes Air” and “Being Mortal.” 
687	@BillGates	a	I’ve read some terrific books lately. Here are a few you might want to try this summer. Also, puppies… (CC @CuteEmergency): https://t.co/yS8oBlQoIG 
688	@BillGates	a	From Lincoln to Leonardo, I hope you enjoy my summer reading list. 
689	@BillGates	a	At @MDCollege, smarter advising is helping students go further faster. 
690	@BillGates	a	Glad to see this story told. I’m always inspired by the local leaders and health workers involved in the fight to #endpolio. 
691	@BillGates	a	In the early days of Microsoft, I felt pretty confident about my coding skills, but I had a lot to learn about management. I wish I had @johndoerr’s new book back then. 
692	@BillGates	a	France has been a leading champion in the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria.  Their generosity has helped us make terrific progress. 
693	@BillGates	a	I recently caught a glimpse at the future of higher ed: https://t.co/42muSNzC4V 
694	@BillGates	a	My visit to @UCF made me wish I could be a college student all over again. 
695	@BillGates	a	Exciting to see how digital tech combined with human ingenuity is transforming the lives of the world’s poorest farmers. 
696	@BillGates	a	Dollar Street is a beautiful reminder that we all have more in common than we think: https://t.co/rUF4GUXIhm

701	@BillGates	a	Real-world superheroes rarely make the headlines. But what if that wasn't the case? A stirring piece by Bollywood actor @SrBachchan. 
702	@BillGates	a	The students who joined Melinda and me for this @60Minutes segment are incredible role models for other young people. We learned a lot from talking with them. 
703	@BillGates	a	America’s financial aid system is failing the students who need it the most: https://t.co/WFcOGReZvH 
704	@BillGates	a	A universal flu vaccine would be a huge boon to global health. That’s why our foundation is partnering with the Page family to fund researchers working on innovative approaches. 
705	@BillGates	a	Of all the low-income high school seniors who qualify for federal student loans or grants, only half apply. Here are three steps we can take to change that: https://t.co/TL8mnHMwAG 
706	@BillGates	a	A low-income student is five times less likely than a high-income student to have a college degree by age 24. Here’s how we can fix that. 
707	@BillGates	a	We’re not ready for the next epidemic – but we can be. 
708	@BillGates	a	Last summer, I asked my followers to help me distribute 100,000 bed nets through @WorldVisionUSA. In this photo essay, you can see how those nets are making a difference in Mozambique: https://t.co/fakmEiCz42 
709	@BillGates	a	This simple intervention could be an effective and scalable approach to saving children’s lives. 
710	@BillGates	a	I always enjoy being back at my alma mater… 
711	@BillGates	a	Vaccines are a miracle. We have a shared responsibility to ensure that all children, no matter where they live, have a shot at life. #VaccinesWork 
712	@BillGates	a	Today is #WorldMalariaDay. Join me in my latest VR video to find out what it will take to #endmalaria: https://t.co/bFbERIlgDO 
713	@BillGates	a	A mind-blowing fact...mosquitoes will kill more people today than sharks do in a century: https://t.co/qW2OWTgnt6 
714	@BillGates	a	Mosquitoes are the greatest killers of all time. We have killed more people than all the wars in history. But no one is impressed by me. #IAmHartmut 
715	@BillGates	a	In 2016, sharks killed four people in the entire world. Diseases spread by mosquitoes killed more than half a million people. So why do sharks get their own week and not me? 
716	@BillGates	a	Why does everyone hate mosquitoes? #IAmHartmut 
717	@BillGates	a	This is a pivotal moment. We need to adapt to the climate change that is already affecting the planet, and develop new tools that will keep the problem from getting worse. Innovation is key to doing both. #EarthDay2018 
718	@BillGates	a	Data nerds like me will enjoy this @planetmoney episode featuring one of my favorite economists, @MaxCRoser.

720	@BillGates	a	This is how we’ll win the war against malaria: https://t.co/N7cyVO9XT2 
721	@BillGates	a	Congrats to my friend @johndoerr on “Measure What Matters.” John is right: companies can’t improve what they don’t measure. 
722	@BillGates	a	As an investor, I’m always on the lookout for the next big idea. That’s why I was excited when our foundation signed on to @TheAudaciousPrj – an innovative way to fund bold non-profits. Here is the first round of winners: https://t.co/kgAJawfdRm 
723	@BillGates	a	The UK is an indispensable partner in the fight against malaria. I’m excited about what we can continue to achieve together. #CHOGM18 
724	@BillGates	a	The world has made incredible progress in the fight against malaria -- but we can’t stop now. 
725	@BillGates	a	Congrats @Trevornoah on the launch of your foundation. I can’t wait to see what you accomplish. 
726	@BillGates	a	.@MohamedBinZayed and the UAE's strong commitment to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is one reason we're closer than ever to ending polio. 
727	@BillGates	a	1,200 scientists, 65,000 local officials, 140,000 industry representatives, and 21 million farmers. This is a story about how data can help change the world. 
728	@BillGates	a	Metamaterials are making the leap from lab to market. Here’s why they’re such an exciting area of research. 
729	@BillGates	a	Can one person really make a difference? Here is one reason why my answer is yes: https://t.co/ss0HB0Xbux 
730	@BillGates	a	I’ve read a couple @johngreen’s books and enjoyed them. Here’s why readers of all ages will enjoy his latest novel: https://t.co/f1Vkrfpkdj #TBT 
731	@BillGates	a	Genome editing is one of the most powerful technologies of the 21st century. It’s important that new tools such as CRISPR continue to be applied – subject to rigorous guidelines – so the world can continue to make remarkable progress. 
732	@BillGates	a	Congrats to @henrytimms and @jeremyheimans  on “New Power.” Looks like an interesting read. 
733	@BillGates	a	Smil is absolutely right that the transition to clean energy will not happen overnight. Here is a chart showing that energy transitions can take many decades. 
734	@BillGates	a	Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite authors. I’ve read nearly all of his 37 books. This is an excellent overview of how Smil has helped shape how people (myself included) think about energy. 
735	@BillGates	a	Ironman triathlete and polio survivor @mindadentler’s story is incredible. Her commitment to eradicating the disease that paralyzed her inspires me to keep fighting to #endpolio. 
736	@BillGates	a	This is one of the most educational books I’ve ever read: https://t.co/6b6qd1k5Zc 
737	@BillGates	a	Congrats to John Hennessy and David Patterson on receiving the Turing Award. The tech industry owes a debt of gratitude to you both. 
738	@BillGates	a	I can’t recommend Factfulness highly enough. Hans and two family members wrote it at the end of his life, and it’s a wonderful summary of everything he stood for. Here’s my full review. 
739	@BillGates	a	I use this one all the time: “Big numbers always look big. Small numbers on their own are misleading… Always look for comparisons.” 
740	@BillGates	a	“Slow change is still change.” Extreme poverty has gone down by an average 2.5% per year in the last two decades. Over time, that adds up to a 50% drop. 
741	@BillGates	a	“Give the system some credit.” It’s great to celebrate heroes (I do!). But there were heroes 1,000 years ago, and life was awful. Modernity—being able to flush the toilet and turn on the lights—is a miracle of systems plus heroes. 
742	@BillGates	a	“Things can be both better and bad.” This is the heart of our foundation’s work. It’s bad that 5 million children die every year—but it’s better than it was, which is why I think it can keep improving. 
743	@BillGates	a	“Factfulness,” by the late Hans Rosling, is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It’s a great guide to thinking clearly about the world. Here are some of my favorite tips… 
744	@BillGates	a	It’s hard to pick up on progress if you divide the world into developed countries and developing countries. In his newly-released book, Hans Rosling offers a better framework. You can download a free excerpt here…

2703	@BarackObama	a	When @POTUS signed the American Rescue Plan, it led to the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. Now close to 1 million people have signed up for health care since February. Make sure you're covered at https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. 
2704	@BarackObama	a	Happy Mother’s Day to @MichelleObama and all the moms celebrating today. I hope you take a moment to thank the women who love you in that special way that mothers do, and remember those who are no longer with us. 
2705	@BarackObama	a	He was exactly what we needed and more than we ever expected. We will miss him dearly. 
2706	@BarackObama	a	He tolerated all the fuss that came with being in the White House, had a big bark but no bite, loved to jump in the pool in the summer, was unflappable with children, lived for scraps around the dinner table, and had great hair. 
2707	@BarackObama	a	Today our family lost a true friend and loyal companion. For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, gentle presence in our lives—happy to see us on our good days, our bad days, and everyday in between. 
2708	@BarackObama	a	Zahrah’s story is a reminder that the Obama Presidential Center isn’t just about creating a place for people to visit. It’s about investing in the South Side, and giving Chicagoans an opportunity to build a brighter future. 
2709	@BarackObama	a	Happy 90th birthday to Willie Mays! If it wasn't for folks like Willie and Jackie Robinson, I might never have made it to the White House. The spirit he played with and the way he carried himself changed the game and people’s attitudes. I’m glad he’s still going strong. 
2710	@BarackObama	a	It was because of them I was able to travel to New York City later that week and tell some of the people who had a loved one murdered by al Qaeda on September 11: America has never forgotten your loss. Watch my full conversation with Bill: 
2711	@BarackObama	a	Bernie Wong was a trailblazer who spent her life advocating for Asian Americans and immigrant communities in Chicago and across the U.S. Her legacy of community leadership inspired me and so many others, and her impact will be felt for generations to come. 
2712	@BarackObama	a	During President @JoeBiden’s first 100 days, the economy has created more than 1 million jobs, more than 200 million shots have been administered, and we’re on our way to cutting child poverty in half. And as we saw last night, this is just the beginning. 
2713	@BarackObama	a	States have just learned how many seats they have in Congress for the next decade. This process is an important step in making sure our maps—and electoral process—better reflect our communities. Get involved in the fight for fair maps with @AllOnTheLine: 
2714	@BarackObama	a	The world’s attention must remain on Myanmar, where I’ve been appalled by heartbreaking violence against civilians and inspired by the nationwide movement that represents the voice of the people. 
2715	@BarackObama	a	I love wandering into independent bookstores and discovering new voices and new authors. So on Independent Bookstore Day, I wanted to talk with some of the folks who help support authors and nourish our communities. 
2716	@BarackObama	a	No challenge poses a greater threat to our planet and to future generations than climate change. I’m proud that the @ObamaFoundation supports young people leading this fight and that the Obama Presidential Center reflects our commitment to sustainability. 
2717	@BarackObama	a	Today, a jury did the right thing. But true justice requires much more. Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family, and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied. 
2718	@BarackObama	a	I want to share a new book, Power to the Public, that illustrates how nonprofits and governments can use technology to solve some of the most pressing issues of our time. It includes some good examples and is worth a read for anyone who cares about making change happen. 
2719	@BarackObama	a	Charles and @Shaq agree: we can all help end this pandemic by getting the COVID-19 vaccine. It's the only way to keep everyone safe and help us get back to all the things we miss most—from seeing family and friends to watching sports in person. 
2720	@BarackObama	a	After nearly two decades in Afghanistan, it’s time to recognize that we have accomplished all that we can militarily, and bring our remaining troops home. I support @POTUS’s bold leadership in building our nation at home and restoring our standing around the world. 
2721	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I are thrilled to be one step closer to bringing the Obama Presidential Center to the South Side of Chicago. We hope it will help lift up the South Side and breathe new life into Jackson Park and the surrounding communities. 
2722	@BarackObama	a	You can find resources and ways to help here: 
2723	@BarackObama	a	Our hearts are heavy over yet another shooting of a Black man, Daunte Wright, at the hands of police. It’s important to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but this is also a reminder of just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country. 
2724	@BarackObama	a	Through his extraordinary example, His Royal Highness Prince Philip proved that true partnership has room for both ambition and selflessness — all in service of something greater. Our thoughts are with Her Majesty the Queen, the Royal Family, and the British people. 
2725	@BarackObama	a	The only way we’ll be able to beat this pandemic is if enough people get vaccinated. So join me, Michelle, and Americans everywhere in getting the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it’s available to you—and encourage your friends and family to do the same. https://t.co/HSjb2DUl4u 
2726	@BarackObama	a	Bruce @Springsteen and I close out our podcast, Renegades: Born in the USA, back where it all began: with a conversation about the story of America and how to restore faith in its promise. Listen to our final episode on Spotify. https://t.co/KWmDc2YBLv 
2727	@BarackObama	a	Read about other developments from communities working together to reimagine policing in our recent @MBK_Alliance report. 
2728	@BarackObama	a	More places are experimenting with programs that send civilian responders instead of police to help people experiencing mental health crises. It’s a promising development in law enforcement in the wake of this summer’s protests. 
2729	@BarackObama	a	This Easter, I hope we can all take some time to reflect on the blessings we enjoy and the hope we have for a brighter future. From our family to yours, have a safe and happy Easter. 
2730	@BarackObama	a	It’s always great catching up with @IsabelWilkerson, and this time we’re talking about A Promised Land and our mutual love of books with @BNBuzz. Take a look: 
2731	@BarackObama	a	Bruce and I agree that our most important anchor over the years has been our families. We’re both lucky enough to have remarkable partners who ground us, and kids who help us understand what really matters in life. Listen to our conversation on @Spotify: https://t.co/Tdl0izWsup 
2732	@BarackObama	a	My family and I are mourning the loss of our beloved grandmother, Sarah Ogwel Onyango Obama, affectionately known to many as “Mama Sarah” but known to us as “Dani” or Granny. We will miss her dearly, but we’ll celebrate with gratitude her long and remarkable life. 
2733	@BarackObama	a	As we build the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago, we're focused on generating sustainable jobs for the local community. Our new workforce initiative will open doors to those often left out of the construction industry. 
2734	@BarackObama	a	Let’s be clear: This is a deliberate attempt to undermine our democracy by making it harder to vote. That’s why passing the For the People Act is so important, and why every one of us needs to keep up the fight. Our future depends on it. 
2735	@BarackObama	a	As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It’s an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. 
2736	@BarackObama	a	A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country. It’s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough. 
2737	@BarackObama	a	Join me, @ProtectOurCare, and health care advocates from across the country to discuss 11 years of the Affordable Care Act and the work we still need to do to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. Watch now: 
2738	@BarackObama	a	Bruce @Springsteen and I both had complicated relationships with our fathers. In our latest conversation on Renegades: Born in the USA, we discuss our upbringing, masculinity, and the role our fathers played in helping us become the men we are today. https://t.co/FNriJIUw3r 
2739	@BarackObama	a	11 years after the Affordable Care Act was passed, it’s getting even better. I’ll be having a conversation with @ProtectOurCare this Monday, March 22 at 1:15 PM ET and hope you’ll join: 
2740	@BarackObama	a	.@POTUS set a goal to deliver 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. His administration hit the milestone in just 58. Let’s keep it going: Please get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It’s the only way to beat this pandemic. 
2741	@BarackObama	a	Like many of you, I’m thrilled that #MarchMadness is finally back. You can check out my picks here: https://t.co/S5mlQofvAp 
2742	@BarackObama	a	I could not be prouder of the @ChiPubSchools students I spoke with recently about A Promised Land. One of the reasons I wrote this book was for young people to be able to see themselves in my story—and I hope our conversation left them as inspired as it left me. 
2743	@BarackObama	a	For the latest episode of our podcast, I talk to Bruce @Springsteen about my time as a community organizer and the influences that led to me pursuing a career in public service. Take a listen on Spotify: https://t.co/pxARdCUpFO 
2744	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it’s the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again. So I hope you’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It could save your life. 
2745	@BarackObama	a	From my first cross-country road trip as a child to Bruce’s experience coming of age toward the end of the Vietnam War, @Springsteen and I each continue to reflect on moments from our upbringing that helped shape our view of America. Listen here: https://t.co/3vQxU2zQub 
2746	@BarackObama	a	Fifty-six years after Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet over. There are more steps to be taken, more bridges to be crossed. And that’s why the Obama Presidential Center is designed to honor the giants who carried us and inspire the next generation to lead us forward. 
2747	@BarackObama	a	.@BillGates' new book is an exceptionally clear and accessible primer on climate change. He's unblinking in the difficulty of meeting this challenge but maintains a cautious optimism that it can be met—and provides a framework for action that is both specific and workable. 
2748	@BarackObama	a	And as we rightly celebrate what Democrats accomplished in the 2020 election, it’s always worth analyzing those successes in depth—and looking at where we came up short—as we look toward future cycles. This interview includes some ideas worth considering: 
2749	@BarackObama	a	The Biden administration’s commitment to democratic values at home and abroad couldn’t be more important—because democracy remains at risk around the world: 
2750	@BarackObama	a	If you haven’t read Michelle’s memoir yet, I hope you do—especially if the young readers’ edition might resonate with you or someone you know. Becoming isn’t just a title—it’s a process we all go through, and Miche’s story brings that to life with real honesty and beauty. 
2751	@BarackObama	a	Like so many others, Michelle and I benefited from Vernon Jordan's wise counsel and warm friendship—and deeply admired his tireless fight for civil rights. We hope the memory of his extraordinary presence and the legacy of his work bring comfort to Ann, Vickee, and his family. 
2752	@BarackObama	a	Music has always been an important part of my life, and I think it’s safe to say that the same is true for @Springsteen. In this episode, we talked about the songs that’ve made a difference for us—and Bruce even brought out the guitar. Listen on @Spotify: https://t.co/pUlY5kGQnZ 
2753	@BarackObama	a	To date, My Brother’s Keeper has touched thousands of lives, and these are just a few stories of the inspiring young men we’ve met. By joining the @MBK_Alliance, you can help us reach even more. 
2754	@BarackObama	a	Today marks seven years since we launched My Brother’s Keeper to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. And it remains true that the only way our country lives up to its ideals is if our young people can reach their fullest potential. 
2755	@BarackObama	a	I first picked up Toni Morrison’s novels when I was entering college, and her voice fundamentally changed my perspective on the world. This Black History Month, I reflected on the impact that her writing has had on my life. https://t.co/zSLkfkHmET 
2756	@BarackObama	a	It was great to hear from this impressive group of young leaders. If there's one thing we can bank on, it’s that young folks like these are our best hope for a more sustainable and just world. 
2757	@BarackObama	a	In each of us, there's a story to be shared—a story that’s sacred and can bring us together. I had such a good time talking with the @WellReadBlkGirl Book Club about A Promised Land because just as they learned about my story, I had a chance to learn from theirs. 
2758	@BarackObama	a	Even as we focus on fighting COVID-19, it’s important to recognize that there’s another pandemic raging right now—one that’s decades in the making and unique to the United States. We need to treat gun violence with the same urgency and resolve. 
2759	@BarackObama	a	Last year, I sat down with my good friend Bruce @Springsteen for a long and meaningful conversation that touched on so much of what we’re all dealing with these days. I’m excited to share it with you over the next few weeks: https://t.co/sQACD08AWx 
2760	@BarackObama	a	I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign. It's a story we can all learn from—a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. 
2761	@BarackObama	a	I felt inspired and hopeful after speaking with students in @TheTellingRoom’s Young Writers &amp; Leaders program. I wrote #APromisedLand in part because I hoped to reach young people like those in this group—the unique voices of a new generation, energized and unafraid to dream big. 
2762	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I are thinking of everyone across the country braving the winter storms this week. Here’s an overview of how you can help—or, if you’re in Texas, where you can go to stay warm or get support. 
2763	@BarackObama	a	Great news: Thanks to President Biden, starting today, you can go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod to sign up for health insurance. If you’re uninsured or hoping to change plans, here’s a good article that can help you figure out if you’re eligible. 
2764	@BarackObama	a	Happy Valentine’s Day to the three who never fail to make me smile. Your dazzling light makes everything brighter. 
2765	@BarackObama	a	During our time in the White House, Michelle and I were proud to display artwork from artists like Alma Thomas and Charles Alston—whose work provoked thought, challenged our assumptions, and shaped how we define our narrative as a country. 
2766	@BarackObama	a	Climate change is a real threat to us all—but feeling helpless or overwhelmed isn’t going to solve it. As long as we stay hopeful and keep working with the urgency the challenge demands, we can make a difference. 
2767	@BarackObama	a	Black-owned independent bookstores play a critical role in communities all across our country. I wanted to show my support, so I dropped in to surprise the folks from @MahoganyBooks &amp; the Very Smart Brothas Book Club. Take a look. 
2768	@BarackObama	a	When Jackie Robinson faced down slurs, spiked cleats, and pitches aimed at his head—and stole home anyway—he didn't only change baseball. He changed the world and paved the way for others, including me. On his birthday, we’re called not only to honor that legacy but build on it. 
2769	@BarackObama	a	In her extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson was one of the rare award-winning actors whose work on the screen was surpassed only by what she was able to accomplish off of it. She had a heart unlike any other—and for 96 years, she left a mark on the world that few will ever match. 
2770	@BarackObama	a	.@EkpeUdoh—I saw your tweet about A Promised Land and thought I’d respond. For me, the title of my book is about the work we need to do to realize the promise of becoming a more perfect union, even if we don’t get there in our lifetimes. Glad to see your book club is reading it! https://t.co/aVRMxwt5JH 
2771	@BarackObama	a	Hank Aaron was one of the best baseball players we’ve ever seen and one of the strongest people I’ve ever met. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Aaron family and everyone who was inspired by this unassuming man and his towering example. 
2772	@BarackObama	a	"On a day for the history books, @TheAmandaGorman delivered a poem that more than met the moment. Young people like her are proof that ""there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it; if only we're brave enough to be it."" "
2773	@BarackObama	a	Congratulations to my friend, President @JoeBiden! This is your time. 
2774	@BarackObama	a	On #MLKDay, we celebrate his life but we’re also called to live out his values through service of our own. Here are some ways you can get involved in your community: 
2775	@BarackObama	a	If anyone had a right to question whether our democracy was worth redeeming, it was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Because in the face of billy clubs and lynchings, poll taxes and literacy tests, he never gave in to violence, never waved a traitorous flag or gave up on our country. 
2776	@BarackObama	a	Happy birthday to my love, my partner, and my best friend. Every moment with you is a blessing. Love you, Miche. 
2777	@BarackObama	a	Here’s my statement on today’s violence at the Capitol. 
2778	@BarackObama	a	My friend John Lewis is surely smiling down on his beloved Georgia this morning, as people across the state carried forward the baton that he and so many others passed down to them. 
2779	@BarackObama	a	Great to see you out there, Tyriek. First-time voters are making a difference today! 
2780	@BarackObama	a	Thanks for voting, Emily—and thanks even more for committing to stay involved after today. Your state and your country need you! 
2781	@BarackObama	a	If you have questions or run into any issues at your polling location, call the Georgia voter protection hotline at 1-888-730-5816. 
2782	@BarackObama	a	For those looking for ways to help @ReverendWarnock and Jon @Ossoff get elected, you can find opportunities to volunteer from anywhere at 
2783	@BarackObama	a	If you’re a Georgia voter, you can respond tomorrow with the most powerful tool we have as Americans—your vote. Make a plan to vote in person or drop off your mail-in-ballot at a ballot drop box. Check-in with your family and friends to do the same. 
2784	@BarackObama	a	This Christmas looks different for all of us. As we spend time with those we love—in person or virtually—let us celebrate the blessings we cherish, embrace the spirit of giving, and look out for one another. From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! 
2785	@BarackObama	a	It’s unconscionable that there are families worried over the holidays that they’ll be evicted next month. Extending the eviction moratorium was a start, but Congress has to do more to help folks who can’t pay rent because of COVID-related unemployment. 
2786	@BarackObama	a	Here are some of my favorite songs of the year. As usual, I had some valuable consultation from our family music guru, Sasha, to put this together. I hope you find a new song or two to listen to. 
2787	@BarackObama	a	Like everyone else, we were stuck inside a lot this year, and with streaming further blurring the lines between theatrical movies and television features, I’ve expanded the list to include visual storytelling that I’ve enjoyed this year, regardless of format. 
2788	@BarackObama	a	From Willie Mays to Mamie Johnson, the players and teams in the Negro Leagues changed the game of baseball and paved the way for so many today. Glad to see the @MLB officially recognize them as major leaguers. 
2789	@BarackObama	a	As 2020 comes to a close, I wanted to share my annual lists of favorites. I’ll start by sharing my favorite books this year, deliberately omitting what I think is a pretty good book – A Promised Land – by a certain 44th president. I hope you enjoy reading these as much as I did. 
2790	@BarackObama	a	I had some fun answering questions about #APromisedLand for BookTube. I talked to creators about everything from fatherhood, to celebrating science at the White House, to the role strong women played in my life. You can watch the full episode on @YouTube: https://t.co/yCydcrqVW4 
2791	@BarackObama	a	There’s just one day left to sign up for heath care during open enrollment. If you or someone you know needs coverage, head to 
2792	@BarackObama	a	Georgians, today is the first day of early voting – make a plan to vote right now and vote early if you can. Then, make sure your friends and family in Georgia do the same. 
2793	@BarackObama	a	Georgia’s runoff election will determine whether the American people have a Senate that’s actually fighting for them. You can get involved right now—make calls, chip in, and do whatever you can to help elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff: 
2794	@BarackObama	a	Here’s a great way to call voters in Georgia and help them get ready to vote. A couple hours this weekend could help Democrats win the Senate. 
2795	@BarackObama	a	In A Promised Land, I talk about the decisions I had to make during the first few years of my presidency. Here are some thoughts on how I approach tough questions: 
2796	@BarackObama	a	With COVID-19 cases reaching an all-time high this week, we've got to continue to do our part to protect one another. This pandemic is far from over and your actions can help save lives. 
2797	@BarackObama	a	To all of you in Georgia, today is the last day to register to vote in the upcoming runoff election. Take a few minutes right now to register to vote, and then make sure everybody you know is registered, too. https://t.co/2Ob571igh3 
2798	@BarackObama	a	Thanks for sharing Marjon. I hope you get something out of A Promised Land – keep up the good work! 
2799	@BarackObama	a	Glad to see A Promised Land in such good company. 
2800	@BarackObama	a	If you're in Georgia, make sure you and everybody you know is registered to vote by Monday, December 7. And if you turn 18 by January 5, you're eligible to vote in the runoff. Get registered right now: 
2801	@BarackObama	a	Join me for a conversation with the next U.S. Senators from Georgia, @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, along with @StaceyAbrams and @NikemaWilliams. The stakes couldn’t be higher for their runoffs: https://t.co/4fHxACdIge 
2802	@BarackObama	a	The balance of power in the Senate is at stake in Georgia’s runoff election. We’ve got two great candidates—@ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff—who need your support. Go to 
2803	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I are eager to bring the Obama Presidential Center to our hometown—a way to honor the city we love, all those who came before us, and pay tribute to people coming together to do extraordinary things. https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4 
2804	@BarackObama	a	This was fun. I heard Tim and Fred were listening to some of the songs on my A Promised Land playlist, so I decided to drop in and surprise them. We talked about a lot, from Bob Dylan to old-school mixtapes to the role music played in my memoir. https://t.co/8A0cuVNHZI 
2805	@BarackObama	a	My memoir, A Promised Land, is out today. I hope you’ll read it. My goal was to give you some insight into the events and people that shaped me during the early years of my presidency. Most of all, I hope it inspires you to see yourself playing a role in shaping a better world. 
2806	@BarackObama	a	Music has always played an important role in my life—and that was especially true during my presidency. In honor of my book hitting shelves tomorrow, I put together this playlist featuring some memorable songs from my administration. Hope you enjoy it. 
2807	@BarackObama	a	More than anyone else, I wrote my book for young people—as an invitation to once again remake the world, and to bring about, through hard work, determination, and a big dose of imagination, an America that finally aligns with all that is best in us. 
2808	@BarackObama	a	Congratulations to my friends, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris — our next President and Vice President of the United States. 
2809	@BarackObama	a	Thank you Chiney, Nneka, and all of the athletes who are using their platforms and helping people vote in this election. 
2810	@BarackObama	a	Rahul, you're helping make democracy work today. Thank you.

2814	@BarackObama	a	For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president.

2815	@BarackObama	a	Our administration literally left this White House a playbook that would have shown them how to respond before COVID-19 reached our shores. Joe and I revisited it recently. Take a look — and then vote for a leader who will get this virus under control. 
2816	@BarackObama	a	On Tuesday, you can choose change. You can choose a better America. You can elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. I am fired up to be back in Florida – let’s bring this home.

2827	@BarackObama	a	You could be the difference between someone making it out to the polls or staying home. And many states could be decided by a handful of votes. Join me and make some calls for Joe in the last few days of this election: https://t.co/FZknijCx0E 
2828	@BarackObama	a	Always great talking to @KingJames and @MavCarter about everything from this unique NBA season to the importance of voting in every election. Tune in tonight and make your plan to vote: https://t.co/7zfJnABzx1 
2829	@BarackObama	a	Second, volunteer—you can make calls or text voters who can use a nudge to vote for Joe. You can be the difference between someone turning in their ballot or showing up to the polls on Tuesday—or not voting. Head to

2832	@BarackObama	a	An important reminder as millions of folks across the country vote early or make plans to vote on November 3: You have the right to vote. If you run into any issues at your polling place, call 1-866-687-8683 or your voter protection hotline. 
2833	@BarackObama	a	If we pour all our effort into these last five days and vote up and down the ticket like never before, then we will elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. And we will leave no doubt about who we are and what this country stands for. Let's go.

2835	@BarackObama	a	Thanks for making your voice heard, Adam. I know a thing or two about being hopeful in the rain, too. https://t.co/hBMNHE9dYo

2839	@BarackObama	a	Republicans love to say right before an election that they’ll protect preexisting conditions. Well, Joe and I actually did it — and he’ll keep protecting your health care as president. We’ve got eight days left. Vote. 
2840	@BarackObama	a	In the middle of a pandemic, this administration is trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court. Here’s how Joe and I fought to expand health care, protect millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, and actually get it done: 
2841	@BarackObama	a	Felicidades, Sofia — I'll bet your car decorations alone inspired a few folks to head to the polls! Thank you for making your voice heard. It matters. 
2842	@BarackObama	a	Dawn, you're showing us all how it's done — not just making your own voice heard, but helping others do so, too. Kidney cancer doesn't stand a chance. You've got this. 
2843	@BarackObama	a	To anyone considering sitting this election out, look at this image. Then make a plan to vote. You're an inspiration to all of us, Brian — and we're all behind you in this fight. 
2844	@BarackObama	a	Eight months into the pandemic, as new cases are breaking records, we need an administration that’s not going to wave the white flag. A year ago today, @JoeBiden was talking about the leadership we need to get prepared for a pandemic, and he’s got a plan to get it under control. 
2845	@BarackObama	a	In 2020, we show up early — for everything, but especially for voting. Get out there and vote! https://t.co/70CqTO5Gbf 
2846	@BarackObama	a	Hello, Florida! It's #VoteEarlyDay and we’re just 10 days away from this election. I want to see you make a plan today for how you’re going to get involved and vote. Let’s get to work. 
2847	@BarackObama	a	One election won't make everything perfect—but it could make things better. And that's why it’s worth taking a few minutes to vote. It's the best route for us to achieve the changes we want. Make your plan to vote at https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. Let’s bring this home. 
2848	@BarackObama	a	We’re just days away from the election and I know there are a lot of good lawyers out there who want to make sure that voting is safe, secure, and accessible for everybody. If that’s you, I hope you’ll sign up with @WeTheAction to protect the vote: 
2849	@BarackObama	a	Joe has the character and the experience to make our country better - but first, he needs your vote. Make a plan to vote right now and vote as early as you can. https://t.co/Q2RbOQZwv9 
2850	@BarackObama	a	And there’s a lot more on the ballot than voting for president. If you want more information about all the candidates and measures that’ll be on your ballot, this is a good place to start: 
2851	@BarackObama	a	I just voted by mail for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. If you're planning on doing the same, follow all the instructions carefully, and drop it in the mail or at a ballot drop box right away. Here, I’ll show you: 
2852	@BarackObama	a	Great to be back in Philly today. I'm fired up and ready to go! 
2853	@BarackObama	a	13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes. And you don’t have to wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot. Make a plan, vote, and then help your friends and family make a plan at https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. Let’s do this.

2856	@BarackObama	a	One of the most inspiring things about this year has been seeing so many young people organizing, marching, and fighting for change. And to change the game on any of the issues we care about, we've got to vote for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. 
2857	@BarackObama	a	Bob Bauer and @JacklGoldsmith's new book is a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the issues at stake as we debate the role of the presidency in the coming years. It's worth a read. 
2858	@BarackObama	a	From police reform to funding our schools, the officials with the most power to change the issues we care about in our communities are often found at the state and local levels. So educate yourselves up and down the ticket, make a plan to vote, and vote: https://t.co/70CqTO5Gbf 
2859	@BarackObama	a	.@PeteSouza was always there to document every moment of my presidency, from high-stakes meetings with world leaders to quiet mornings reading briefing memos. The @WayISeeItFilm is one to watch—and a reminder to get registered and make a plan to vote. https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T 
2860	@BarackObama	a	Democrats winning control of the Senate will make all the difference on how much progress we can achieve on health care, supporting working families, and more. Join @CatherineForNV and me for today's grassroots event: 
2861	@BarackObama	a	Nobody should have to wait 11 hours to vote, but we’re all grateful that you—and all those in line with you—stuck it out. Keep making your voices heard, everybody. Our democracy depends on it. 
2862	@BarackObama	a	There’s still so much work to do to make our communities safe and supportive for everybody. Elected officials can join us by taking the @MBK_Alliance’s Reimagining Policing Pledge: 
2863	@BarackObama	a	We've only got 20 days to go until Election Day – and we've got to vote for @JoeBiden and Democrats up and down the ballot. I talked to @PodSaveAmerica about this election, the 2020 Census, and the role we can all play to create change in the months ahead. 
2864	@BarackObama	a	.@JohnBrennan is one of the hardest-working, most patriotic public servants I’ve ever seen, and our country is better off for it. As president, he was one of my closest advisors and a great friend. And in his memoir, Undaunted, you’ll see why. I hope you’ll read it. 
2865	@BarackObama	a	This article is worth a read to learn more about why you should respond and what makes the 2020 Census different: 
2866	@BarackObama	a	Complete the Census before it's too late—it determines the resources your community will get over the next decade, from funding for roads and Medicare to political representation. Take a few minutes before the deadline tomorrow: Call 844-330-2020 or visit

2869	@BarackObama	a	Proud of my friend @KingJames for his fourth title, fourth Finals MVP, and for not only living up to the hype after seventeen seasons, but surpassing it as an extraordinary leader both on the court and in the public arena fighting for education, social justice, and our democracy. 
2870	@BarackObama	a	A couple years ago, I met some promising young men working to prevent gun violence with @ChicagoCred. Talking with them reminded me that one of the best ways to make our communities safer is simple: Listen to—and invest in—voices like theirs. 
2871	@BarackObama	a	And make sure you watch his full speech—one of the best I've seen Joe give: 
2872	@BarackObama	a	We have the opportunity to elect a leader who will unify this nation. And that leader is @JoeBiden. We don't have a moment to waste. https://t.co/Q2RbOQZwv9 
2873	@BarackObama	a	It’s going to take a lot of big-thinking and innovation to save the one planet we’ve got—and that’s why @KensingtonRoyal’s leadership on climate change can make a real difference. 
2874	@BarackObama	a	There's so much at stake in this election––and millions of Americans have already started voting. If you haven't already, make a plan to join them right now. Visit

2876	@BarackObama	a	#ImVotingFor the future of our democracy—for the young folks who will inherit whatever we leave them. They’ll take the baton from us and do their part to keep carrying progress forward. But it’s our time right now. And the best way to do that is to vote early for @JoeBiden. 
2877	@BarackObama	a	.@JoeBiden has a plan to build our country back better and create millions of jobs—jobs that can help working families get ahead. Joe helped manage the Recovery Act, which jumpstarted the longest stretch of job growth in our history. And he’ll do it again. 
2878	@BarackObama	a	This is as powerful an argument as I’ve heard about the stakes of this election. Watch it. Share it. And get everyone you know to vote for @JoeBiden. https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T 
2879	@BarackObama	a	States across the country have voter registration deadlines coming up––and many of them are today. Do your part to protect this democracy and change our country for the better. Register or check your registration, and make a plan to vote: https://t.co/Q5BUeMaOB5 
2880	@BarackObama	a	Don’t wait—complete the Census today. From funding for education, health care, and infrastructure in your community to the way you’re represented in government, getting counted matters. Take a minute to call 844-330-2020 or visit 
2881	@BarackObama	a	Last night, I surprised a group of first-time poll workers at the @NBA Finals. These @MoreThanAVote volunteers are stepping up to make sure this election runs safely and fairly in their communities –– and you can too by signing up to volunteer at https://t.co/Ge4XvvPwpW. 
2882	@BarackObama	a	I'm looking forward to catching up with @KamalaHarris and folks around the country at our grassroots fundraiser tomorrow to talk about what's at stake in this election. You still have time to join us! I hope to see you there: https://t.co/SEmQcX6u3z 
2883	@BarackObama	a	Joe knows this isn’t about him—it’s about us. Make your plan to vote right now. We’ve got to vote like our democracy depends on it. Because it does. https://t.co/Q2RbOQZwv9 
2884	@BarackObama	a	I’m proud to endorse these outstanding Democratic candidates who will work to get the virus under control, rebuild the economy and the middle class, and protect Americans’ health care and preexisting conditions protections. Support these candidates––and vote early if you can. 
2885	@BarackObama	a	You don't need me to tell you what's at stake in this election. Now is the time to show up and vote like never before to elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. Educate yourself on the candidates running and vote: https://t.co/Q2RbOQZwv9 
2886	@BarackObama	a	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought to the end, through her cancer, with unwavering faith in our democracy and its ideals. That’s how we remember her. But she also left instructions for how she wanted her legacy to be honored. My statement: 
2887	@BarackObama	a	If you're looking for a way to get involved in this upcoming election, sign up to volunteer as a poll worker for early voting and Election Day. You can help your community and make sure this election runs fairly and safely. Sign up: https://t.co/Ge4XvvPwpW 
2888	@BarackObama	a	There’s no feeling like finishing a book, and I’m proud of this one. In A Promised Land, I try to provide an honest accounting of my presidency, the forces we grapple with as a nation, and how we can heal our divisions and make democracy work for everybody. 
2889	@BarackObama	a	Today we remember the lives we lost on 9/11. Even the smallest act of service is a way to honor them. And just like Jay Winuk, we can honor their memories through service. https://t.co/BdKDozK5t0 
2890	@BarackObama	a	The fires across the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities. Protecting our planet is on the ballot. Vote like your life depends on it—because it does. 
2891	@BarackObama	a	Great to catch up with our next Vice President, @KamalaHarris. I wanted to make sure to share a few tips about serving alongside our friend @JoeBiden.

2893	@BarackObama	a	Right now, far too many marginalized communities and people of color aren't being counted. The impact of this could be felt for decades in our communities. Make sure you and your neighbors get counted: 
2894	@BarackObama	a	Completing the Census is crucial because it will shape our communities for the next decade. Everything from critical funds and resources for health care, infrastructure, and education to political representation. Complete it now online, by phone, or mail: 
2895	@BarackObama	a	Joe and Kamala have what it takes to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. Join me in helping them get elected: 
2896	@BarackObama	a	.@JoeBiden is a man who learned to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him: “No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.” That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts—that’s who Joe is. 
2897	@BarackObama	a	If you can volunteer as a poll worker for early voting and Election Day, I hope you’ll do it. You can help make sure this election runs fairly and safely—and that’s one of the most crucial things any of us can do for our country right now. Sign up here: https://t.co/ZtXWL9aTlM 
2898	@BarackObama	a	Chadwick came to the White House to work with kids when he was playing Jackie Robinson. You could tell right away that he was blessed. To be young, gifted, and Black; to use that power to give them heroes to look up to; to do it all while in pain – what a use of his years. 
2899	@BarackObama	a	If you’re looking to take action—or looking to educate yourselves on these issues—we’ve gathered some resources from the @ObamaFoundation that can help at 
2900	@BarackObama	a	I commend the players on the @Bucks for standing up for what they believe in, coaches like @DocRivers, and the @NBA and @WNBA for setting an example. It’s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values. 
2901	@BarackObama	a	Don’t let them convince you that your vote doesn’t matter. Make a plan to vote and register at 
2902	@BarackObama	a	Tonight our next President @JoeBiden made the case for his vision for this country and his plan to get there. I'll be doing everything I can over these next 75 days to make sure we get it done. Join us:

2904	@BarackObama	a	Congrats, Joe. I’m proud of you. 
2905	@BarackObama	a	The 19th amendment is the legacy of all those who marched and organized for transformational legislative change. Progress isn’t about just politics or protest––it’s about both. 100 years later, we’re all so much better off because of their commitment. 
2906	@BarackObama	a	This is the Joe I know. 
2907	@BarackObama	a	As Michelle said, we’ve got to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. So make sure you have a plan to vote. Vote early. And tell everybody you know to register to vote at https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T. 
2908	@BarackObama	a	Over the past few months, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to music with my family. I wanted to share some of my favorites from the summer—including songs from some of the artists at this week’s @DemConvention. Hope you enjoy it. 
2909	@BarackObama	a	I talked to @davidplouffe about these attempts to undermine the election, what’s at stake right now, and why we have to do everything we can to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. 
2910	@BarackObama	a	I’ve known Senator @KamalaHarris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job. She’s spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. This is a good day for our country. Now let’s go win this thing. 
2911	@BarackObama	a	I will never forget the commitment to reconciliation and peace that I encountered in Hiroshima in 2016. The memory of August 6, 1945, must never fade; it allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. 
2912	@BarackObama	a	We have to treat voting as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy. So make sure you are registered to vote. Request a mail-in ballot early and send it back early. Then get your family and friends to do it, too. Every vote counts. 
2913	@BarackObama	a	I’m proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful, empathetic, and highly qualified Democrats. If you’re in one of their districts or states, make sure you vote for them this fall. And if you can, vote early—by mail or in person. https://t.co/PSm3Rf3wkF 
2914	@BarackObama	a	Welcome home, @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug! We launched the Commercial Crew program to strengthen our U.S. space program and it's been great to see its success. This historic NASA-SpaceX mission is a symbol of what American ingenuity and inventiveness can achieve. 
2915	@BarackObama	a	This pandemic is far from over––and our medical professionals continue to put their lives on the line to keep our country going. @JoeBiden and I had a chance to thank Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer for his work during the Ebola crisis and this current pandemic. 
2916	@BarackObama	a	John believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage and a longing to do what’s right. We are so lucky to have had him show us the way. I offered some thoughts today on his life and how, like him, we can give it all we have. 
2917	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I have spent a lot of time together these past few months. We’ve had a lot of good talks—and this one’s up there with the best. Take a listen to the very first episode of Michelle’s podcast: https://t.co/JEaVgT6GPC. 
2918	@BarackObama	a	It's National Vote By Mail Day. Voting by mail is easy and safe. Take a few minutes to request your vote-by-mail ballot, then get your family and friends to do the same.

2919	@BarackObama	a	We're 100 days away from Election Day and there is too much at stake to sit this one out. Now's a good time to make sure you're registered to vote––and to make sure your friends and family are, too. 
2920	@BarackObama	a	To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I got the chance to talk to the next generation of activists and advocates in the disability rights movement––they're continuing the work of the activists in @CripCampFilm and I couldn't be prouder of them. 
2921	@BarackObama	a	Although we’ve seen some positive findings recently about the possibilities of developing a vaccine for COVID-19, this article gives a good summary of why it may take months before any effective vaccine can be widely distributed. 
2922	@BarackObama	a	Doesn’t get much better than sitting down to talk with my friend Joe. 
2923	@BarackObama	a	Ten years ago, I signed Wall Street reform into law. It was the most sweeping set of financial regulations since the Great Depression—and it’s still working today to prevent another one. Now, it’s up to us to protect it and keep fighting for an economy that works for everybody. 
2924	@BarackObama	a	Some thoughts on the Reverend C.T. Vivian, a pioneer who pulled America closer to our founding ideals and a friend who I will miss greatly. 
2925	@BarackObama	a	Get registered and find out how you can vote by mail at 
2926	@BarackObama	a	Voting by mail shouldn't be a partisan issue––especially during a pandemic. Everybody should be able to request an absentee ballot, and make their voice heard in every election. 
2927	@BarackObama	a	Our founding promise has never been guaranteed. Each generation has been called to bring us a little closer to our highest ideals—and history’s calling on us right now. So let’s all do whatever we can to help @JoeBiden expand that promise to all Americans. 
2928	@BarackObama	a	Today I’m tipping my hat to all the giants in the Negro Leagues, from Satchel Paige to Toni Stone and so many others. Their brave example, first set 100 years ago, changed America’s pastime for the better––opening it up for new generations of players and fans alike. 
2929	@BarackObama	a	Jim’s courage and persistence helped change America for the better. And so did every American who marched, organized, stood up, came out—or changed their own heart because they love someone who did. Happy anniversary, everybody. 
2930	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I want every kid in Chicago to grow up knowing even better opportunities than we had. We’re happy to help Chicago Connected reach every kid in the city. This is where I found a purpose and a family––and it’ll always be our home. 
2931	@BarackObama	a	Today reminds us that progress might be slow. It might take decades. But no matter what things might look like today, it’s always possible. Happy Pride month, everybody. 
2932	@BarackObama	a	Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen young people in every corner of the country step up and become leaders. Through organization and mobilization, they’re showing us how we can sustain this momentum to bring about real change. 
2933	@BarackObama	a	It’s too early to tell if it’s permanent, but the changes brought on by COVID-19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives. 
2934	@BarackObama	a	We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. 
2935	@BarackObama	a	Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: 
2936	@BarackObama	a	Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: 
2937	@BarackObama	a	First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: 
2938	@BarackObama	a	In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: 
2939	@BarackObama	a	"""Let’s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you’re voting for. And that’s how we're going to hit 'em."" "
2940	@BarackObama	a	Let’s get to work. 
2941	@BarackObama	a	If you want to take concrete action, but you’re not sure how, we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. 
2942	@BarackObama	a	I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. 
2943	@BarackObama	a	My statement on the death of George Floyd: 
2944	@BarackObama	a	If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Here’s a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election: https://t.co/FmN8RCJymg 
2945	@BarackObama	a	The Class of 2020 is full of the leaders we need to bend the arc of history toward a better future—and our HBCU grads have the talent, skills, and vision to lead that change. I couldn't be prouder of all of you. 
2946	@BarackObama	a	As Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. It’s one of the things I love most about the city—and one of the many reasons it’s such a good home for the @ObamaFoundation. 
2947	@BarackObama	a	Congrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who’ve guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! 
2948	@BarackObama	a	Congratulations to the HBCU Class of 2020! Michelle and I are so proud of you. As you set out to change the world, we’ll be the wind at your back. Can’t wait to see what you achieve. 
2949	@BarackObama	a	Graduating is a big achievement no matter what, but with all that the Class of 2020 has dealt with to get across the finish line, I think they’ve earned a little celebration. I hope you’ll all join me in honoring them at 2PM ET and 8PM ET. 
2950	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so we’re reading “The Word Collector” for @chipublib. It’s a fun book that vividly illustrates the transformative power of words––and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. 
2951	@BarackObama	a	Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, we’re already creating something better for tomorrow. 
2952	@BarackObama	a	Even if you can’t give the moms in your life a hug today, I hope you can give them an extra thank you today. Thank you and Happy Mother’s Day to the woman who makes it all possible. Love you, @michelleobama. 
2953	@BarackObama	a	There’s no limit to the devotion I’ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldn’t be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. 
2954	@BarackObama	a	I’ve always loved joining commencements––the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we can’t get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. 
2955	@BarackObama	a	The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository—and food banks in communities like yours—are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who’ve fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. 
2956	@BarackObama	a	The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. 
2957	@BarackObama	a	In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. 
2958	@BarackObama	a	This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all. 
2959	@BarackObama	a	If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. 
2960	@BarackObama	a	While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late. 
2961	@BarackObama	a	We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. 
2962	@BarackObama	a	Parents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.) 
2963	@BarackObama	a	Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other––as neighbors and as citizens. 
2964	@BarackObama	a	When I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. 
2965	@BarackObama	a	Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. 
2966	@BarackObama	a	For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals – now’s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at 
2967	@BarackObama	a	I’m proud to endorse my friend @JoeBiden for President of the United States. Let's go: 
2968	@BarackObama	a	Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship—as they are Americans in every way but on paper. 
2969	@BarackObama	a	Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope––a reminder of rebirth and renewal––and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. 
2970	@BarackObama	a	Let’s not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. 
2971	@BarackObama	a	Everyone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. 
2972	@BarackObama	a	No one should be forced to choose between their right to vote and their right to stay healthy like the debacle in Wisconsin this week. 
2973	@BarackObama	a	Some good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. It’s critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. 
2974	@BarackObama	a	Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and they’ll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work. 
2975	@BarackObama	a	Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring – something we have yet to put in place nationwide. 
2976	@BarackObama	a	My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I’ve turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world. 
2977	@BarackObama	a	Bill Withers was a true American master. His music, rooted in the everyday joys and sorrows of working people, was soulful, wise and life-affirming––a perfect tonic for hard times. 
2978	@BarackObama	a	As she often does, @SenWarren provides a cogent summary of how federal policymakers should be thinking about the pandemic in the coming months. 
2979	@BarackObama	a	It's Census Day and we all have a crucial role to play. Filling out the 2020 Census determines what the next decade will look like for your community: your roads, health care, schools, representation and more. Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. 
2980	@BarackObama	a	We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. 
2981	@BarackObama	a	So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. 
2982	@BarackObama	a	Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family. 
2983	@BarackObama	a	And this article provides a great example of the kind of community spirit that we need to get through this—a spirit that we can hopefully learn to instill more of into our lives, workplaces, civic institutions, and government once the crisis has passed. 
2984	@BarackObama	a	Here’s a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. 
2985	@BarackObama	a	These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake—for theirs. 
2986	@BarackObama	a	Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home. 
2987	@BarackObama	a	Here’s a useful summary of the current best thinking among public health experts on how we need to approach the fight against COVID-19 in the coming weeks. 
2988	@BarackObama	a	Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. 
2989	@BarackObama	a	.@sullydish witnessed the impact of HIV-AIDS on the LGBT community in the early stages of that devastating disease: 
2990	@BarackObama	a	The best part of my job was meeting people like this—ready to make a selfless act in a time of need. Many Americans are already making deep sacrifices to keep our communities healthy, but if you’re able to, consider helping those hit the hardest. 
2991	@BarackObama	a	As communities have begun to recognize the importance of social distancing measures to “flatten the curve” on COVID-19 transmission, here’s a sober but useful primer on what we should expect in the coming months: 
2992	@BarackObama	a	We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody who’ll be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while. They’re giving everything. May we all model our own behavior on their selflessness and sacrifice as we help each other through this. 
2993	@BarackObama	a	Watch this. It shows why we should all do the right thing and stay home to the fullest extent possible. All of us can help slow the spread of the virus, protecting the elderly, the vulnerable, and each other. 
2994	@BarackObama	a	A shout out to Kevin, Giannis, Zion, Blake, Steph and all the players, owners and organizations who are setting a good example during a challenging time. A reminder that we’re a community, and that each of us has an obligation to look out for each other. 
2995	@BarackObama	a	If you’re wondering whether it’s an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here’s a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives. We have to look out for each other. 
2996	@BarackObama	a	In the midst of campaign season, it’s important to look squarely at what’s at stake. This article speaks to one of the disturbing long term trends that we as voters and citizens need to expect our government to address. 
2997	@BarackObama	a	55 years ago, when a group of civil rights organizers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they carried America with them. Today, let's honor that legacy by continuing their work to protect and exercise our foundational right to vote. 
2998	@BarackObama	a	After a lifetime of reaching for the stars, today, Katherine Johnson landed among them. She spent decades as a hidden figure, breaking barriers behind the scenes. But by the end of her life, she had become a hero to millions—including Michelle and me. 
2999	@BarackObama	a	Happy birthday to one of my heroes — someone who believed our right to vote was more important than his own life. Thanks for making good trouble for 80 years, @repjohnlewis. 
3000	@BarackObama	a	Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history. 
3001	@BarackObama	a	Happy Valentine’s Day to my forever dance partner, @MichelleObama. 
3002	@BarackObama	a	What a great example of citizenship, what each of us can do to make a difference for all of us: 
3003	@BarackObama	a	Even if the methods are new, sowing the seeds of doubt, division, and discord to turn Americans against each other is an old trick. The antidote is citizenship: to get engaged, organized, mobilized, and to vote - on every level, in every election. 
3004	@BarackObama	a	Congrats to Julia and Steven, the filmmakers behind American Factory, for telling such a complex, moving story about the very human consequences of wrenching economic change. Glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the Oscar for Higher Ground’s first release. 
3005	@BarackObama	a	Every so often, I re-read Dr. King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail. While some of the injustices may have changed, his poetic brilliance, moral clarity, and tests of conscience still reverberate today. Take a moment to reflect on his righteous call: 
3006	@BarackObama	a	In every scene, you are my star, @MichelleObama! Happy birthday, baby! 
3007	@BarackObama	a	Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico can use our support after this week’s earthquakes. They’ve shown their enduring spirit over the past couple years, and it’s up to us to pull together for one another once again. I hope you’ll support their recovery: 
3008	@BarackObama	a	Here’s the thing: Even with problems of this magnitude, each of us can still find a way to make change. That’s why I’m proud of young people like Alice Mahar, a environmental activist in Melbourne. Read about her and find ways you can help, too: 
3009	@BarackObama	a	The catastrophic fires in Australia are the latest example of the very real and very urgent consequences of climate change. It’s on us to stay focused and protect the one planet we’ve got for the next generation: 
3010	@BarackObama	a	With David Stern’s passing, I’m reflecting on everything he did to take the NBA global, creating entire new generations of fans pretending to be like Mike or any of their favorite players on driveways and playgrounds around the world. 
3011	@BarackObama	a	From hip-hop to country to The Boss, here are my songs of the year. If you’re looking for something to keep you company on a long drive or help you turn up a workout, I hope there’s a track or two in here that does the trick. 
3012	@BarackObama	a	Next up are my favorite movies and TV shows of 2019. Of course, there’s also American Factory, a film from our own production company, Higher Ground, that was recently shortlisted for an Oscar. Here’s the full list: 
3013	@BarackObama	a	As we wind down 2019, I wanted to share with you my annual list of favorites that made the last year a little brighter. We’ll start with books today — movies and music coming soon. I hope you enjoy these as much as I did. 
3014	@BarackObama	a	From the Obama family to yours, Merry Christmas! 
3015	@BarackObama	a	2019 was full of moments that show humanity at its best—compassionate, entrepreneurial, determined. And yes, hopeful. Take a look to see for yourself. 
3016	@BarackObama	a	You can get the zen garden next week, but tomorrow is the last day to sign up for health coverage at https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. This year, most current https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers can find an insurance plan with a monthly premium of $10 or less. Get covered today! 
3017	@BarackObama	a	It was remarkable to be back in the Asia-Pacific region with my sister this week, joined by hundreds of talented and optimistic @ObamaFoundation leaders. They’re making their mark on this region—and the whole world—and that's good for all of us. 
3018	@BarackObama	a	My sister Maya and I are about to take the stage at @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific. We'll be talking about how growing up in this region made us who we are—and the opportunity today's young people have to shape the future. I hope you'll tune in at 
3019	@BarackObama	a	I thought it was about time I share my holiday gift list — a few practical items, all $10 or less. The best one? Health care for you or somebody you care about. The deadline to sign up is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod and get covered. 
3020	@BarackObama	a	In Vietnam I had the chance to sit down with some of our @ObamaFoundation leaders and alumni from across the Asia Pacific. From combating climate change in Vietnam to evaluating social impact in Indonesia, they're doing extraordinary work and expanding their impact together. 
3021	@BarackObama	a	Because of Paul Volcker, our financial system is stronger and safer for the American people. I’ll remember Paul for his consummate wisdom, untethered honesty, and a level of dignity that matched his towering stature. I’m proud to have called him not just an adviser, but a friend. 
3022	@BarackObama	a	Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time — and turkey, and maybe a little football — with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. 
3023	@BarackObama	a	"Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: ""Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity."" "
3024	@BarackObama	a	Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: 
3025	@BarackObama	a	Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. 
3026	@BarackObama	a	Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month. 
3027	@BarackObama	a	Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. 
3028	@BarackObama	a	This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country 
3029	@BarackObama	a	No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. 
3030	@BarackObama	a	Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. 
3031	@BarackObama	a	Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 
3032	@BarackObama	a	Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. 
3033	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. 
3034	@BarackObama	a	In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. 
3035	@BarackObama	a	Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. 
3036	@BarackObama	a	As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it. 
3037	@BarackObama	a	Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! 
3038	@BarackObama	a	On National Voter Registration Day, it’s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at 
3039	@BarackObama	a	Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. 
3040	@BarackObama	a	That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: 
3041	@BarackObama	a	Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. 
3042	@BarackObama	a	As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. 
3043	@BarackObama	a	Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. 
3044	@BarackObama	a	Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. 
3045	@BarackObama	a	Training is at the heart of organizing. It’s why I’ve always made it a priority – from my 2008 campaign until now. And it’s why I’m proud to announce @allontheline’s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: https://t.co/yrWJ50wSdE 
3046	@BarackObama	a	With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy. 
3047	@BarackObama	a	A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground. And it’s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground’s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. 
3048	@BarackObama	a	Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. 
3049	@BarackObama	a	Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: 
3050	@BarackObama	a	The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. 
3051	@BarackObama	a	Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa 
3052	@BarackObama	a	Here’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.” 
3053	@BarackObama	a	I’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better. 
3054	@BarackObama	a	Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: 
3055	@BarackObama	a	Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: 
3056	@BarackObama	a	In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. 
3057	@BarackObama	a	#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. 
3058	@BarackObama	a	I have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud. In fact, you already have. 
3059	@BarackObama	a	The @ObamaFoundation is helping a new generation of leaders make their mark, and there’s an extraordinary group gathering this week for Obama Leaders: Africa. Their work will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent—and make the world better for all of us. 
3060	@BarackObama	a	Proud to rep America’s best team! Congrats @USWNT and thanks for being such a strong inspiration for women and girls—and everybody—all across the country. 
3061	@BarackObama	a	Happy Fourth of July, everybody! This is always a great day in the Obama family: a chance to celebrate America—and Malia’s birthday, too. Hope all of you are able to get some time with friends, family, and fireworks. 
3062	@BarackObama	a	I’m admittedly biased, but this article gibes with my experience about what all of us might take away from the “aloha spirit.” 
3063	@BarackObama	a	No one changes the world alone. That’s why the @ObamaFoundation is connecting emerging leaders from South Africa to Singapore to the South Side of Chicago—so they can change the world together. Read my reflection on our second year: 
3064	@BarackObama	a	The most important job in our democracy is citizen. If you’re tired of politicians manipulating maps and ignoring the will of voters, I hope you’ll sign @allontheline’s Citizen Commitment today: 
3065	@BarackObama	a	50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement. In 2016 I was proud to designate it as a national monument—a reminder the arc of our history is an arc of progress as long as we keep pushing for it. 
3066	@BarackObama	a	What a gift to come across this interview with Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins. I’m as grateful for her life advice as I am impressed by her 100-meter dash time. 
3067	@BarackObama	a	Now we’re talking! Congrats to Team USA for moving on, and thanks for continuing to make us all proud. #USA 
3068	@BarackObama	a	On Juneteenth, we celebrate our capacity to make real the promise of our founding, that thing inside each of us that says America is not yet finished, that compels all of us to fight for justice and equality until this country we love more closely aligns with our highest ideals. 
3069	@BarackObama	a	Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: 
3070	@BarackObama	a	This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. 
3071	@BarackObama	a	Yes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. 
3072	@BarackObama	a	Happy Father’s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers’ Uplift. Today, we’re celebrating fathers like these who provide a powerful example—not only for their kids, but for the rest of us, too. 
3073	@BarackObama	a	The @USWNT is something to smile about. It was great to celebrate with them back in 2015 and I'm excited to root them on in their drive to earn their fourth star. Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam 
3074	@BarackObama	a	Six years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing. Today, I want to join many others in wishing him a speedy recovery of his own. Get well soon, Papi. 
3075	@BarackObama	a	You've got a lot to be proud of, Jiwandeep. Thanks for everything you do to make this country a little more equal. Turban looks great, by the way. Happy Pride Month, everybody! 
3076	@BarackObama	a	What a life. American history has always been driven by visionaries like Leah Chase—and all the men and women who worked and ate at Dooky Chase’s over the years—folks who serve up progress one bowl of gumbo at a time. https://t.co/2LpuIbxvHk 
3077	@BarackObama	a	A story worth sharing: Twelve years ago, Brian joined my first presidential campaign. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS and launched @iamalsorg to find a cure. Brian and Sandra wake up every day believing that we can win this fight—and that makes me hopeful, too. 
3078	@BarackObama	a	Exciting to see the faces of Colombia's future at an @ObamaFoundation roundtable with young leaders in Bogotá. Their creativity, their compassion, and their drive to improve their country are promising signs of what's to come. 
3079	@BarackObama	a	On Memorial Day, we remember all those who gave everything for something greater than themselves. It's up to us to not simply reflect on their sacrifice but to honor it with service of our own—and by living out the values they fought for. 
3080	@BarackObama	a	Great to get out there and take a few cuts at the plate yesterday—I had a blast with all these extraordinary young people. Thanks for letting me drop in and thanks to the Nationals Youth Academy for the outstanding work you do to support youth in DC. 
3081	@BarackObama	a	Here’s a great story: While we’ve still got a lot of work to do to make college affordable for everyone, that didn’t stop Robert F. Smith from seizing an opportunity to make a difference. He’s erasing the student loan debt for this year’s @Morehouse grads. 
3082	@BarackObama	a	Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know—a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. 
3083	@BarackObama	a	As part of the @ObamaFoundation, moms like Dr. Mwansa Ketty Lubeya are answering the call for change—and raising the next generation of leaders while they’re at it. 
3084	@BarackObama	a	Happy #CollegeSigningDay, everybody! I'm proud of every student out there who's taking the next step in their education. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. 
3085	@BarackObama	a	Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c 
3086	@BarackObama	a	For thirty-six years, Richard Lugar proved that pragmatism and decency work—not only in Washington but all over the world. Michelle and I send our warmest sympathies to his family and all those who had the privilege of knowing this American statesman. 
3087	@BarackObama	a	Dominique’s story is a reminder to us that where you’re from shouldn’t define what you can achieve. I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. 
3088	@BarackObama	a	And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. 
3089	@BarackObama	a	I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, “It’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” 
3090	@BarackObama	a	They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. 
3091	@BarackObama	a	To all who celebrate today, happy Easter from our family to yours! On this day of rebirth and renewal, let’s recommit to love and serve our brothers and sisters, especially those in need, in every way we can. Have a great day, everybody. 
3092	@BarackObama	a	Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. 
3093	@BarackObama	a	"Another good story worth sharing: From one ""kid from Akron"" to a new generation of Akron kids, some remarkable early achievements at @IPROMISESchool. Great work, @KingJames—and even better work by those students. Proud to be a witness to their success: "
3094	@BarackObama	a	In just a few minutes, I’m taking the stage at the @ObamaFoundation Town Hall Europe for a conversation about how to best support civic leaders carrying out good work across the continent. I hope you’ll tune in live at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. 
3095	@BarackObama	a	A voice everybody should hear. 
3096	@BarackObama	a	Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: 
3097	@BarackObama	a	Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. 
3098	@BarackObama	a	Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come. 
3099	@BarackObama	a	Just in the nick of time: My brackets have never been my one shining moment, but here we go again. You can check out my #MarchMadness picks here: https://t.co/c3bjNrIo4w 
3100	@BarackObama	a	And here are some ways to help cyclone victims in Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe: 
3101	@BarackObama	a	The floods in the Midwest and in southern Africa are heartbreaking. Suffering and loss on two sides of the world calls for solidarity and strength from all of us. Ask what you can do to help our fellow Americans and families in need. Here are some ideas: 
3102	@BarackObama	a	In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama 
3103	@BarackObama	a	What a great moment. Happy 110th, Virginia. 
3104	@BarackObama	a	The Crew Dragon’s been on quite a ride since I last saw it—congrats to @NASA and @SpaceX on a successful return! We invested in the @Commercial_Crew program to strengthen the U.S. space program for the long haul, and it’s great to see that happening. 
3105	@BarackObama	a	And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. 
3106	@BarackObama	a	.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. 
3107	@BarackObama	a	.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. 
3108	@BarackObama	a	It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7TYE8u0CD. 
3109	@BarackObama	a	I’m about to join @StephenCurry30 on stage with @MBK_Alliance to answer questions from boys and young men of color about the challenges that confront them and the opportunities within their grasp. Tune in at 
3110	@BarackObama	a	I’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. 
3111	@BarackObama	a	Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. 
3112	@BarackObama	a	My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: 
3113	@BarackObama	a	As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. 
3114	@BarackObama	a	The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. 
3115	@BarackObama	a	I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! 
3116	@BarackObama	a	Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. 
3117	@BarackObama	a	Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. 
3118	@BarackObama	a	Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. 
3119	@BarackObama	a	Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. 
3120	@BarackObama	a	As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: 
3121	@BarackObama	a	Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! 
3122	@BarackObama	a	There’s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth. As we celebrate the season and look forward to 2019, let’s recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind. 
3123	@BarackObama	a	Merry Christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at Children’s National. And thanks for humoring me as your stand-in Santa.

3125	@BarackObama	a	Joe is right. Head to https://t.co/SS87NTsgJt before tomorrow’s deadline. And nice bracelet, by the way. 
3126	@BarackObama	a	As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. 
3127	@BarackObama	a	No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. 
3128	@BarackObama	a	America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by George and Barbara’s example. 
3129	@BarackObama	a	I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. 
3130	@BarackObama	a	Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

3132	@BarackObama	a	Our future depends on all our young people, including our boys and young men of color, being able to achieve their dreams. Today, I’m proud to share @MBK_Alliance’s first investments in communities devoted to this mission. Get inspired: 
3133	@BarackObama	a	Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. 
3134	@BarackObama	a	Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: 
3135	@BarackObama	a	Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. 
3136	@BarackObama	a	Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. 
3137	@BarackObama	a	If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! 
3138	@BarackObama	a	Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod.

3146	@BarackObama	a	Today, I’m proud to endorse even more Democratic candidates who aren’t just running against something, but for something—to expand opportunity for all of us and to restore dignity, honor, and compassion to public service. They deserve your vote: 
3147	@BarackObama	a	From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. 
3148	@BarackObama	a	The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith—hardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. 
3149	@BarackObama	a	Today I’m at the University of Illinois to deliver a simple message to young people all over the country: You need to vote, because our democracy depends on it. I hope you'll tune in at 11am CT:

3153	@BarackObama	a	Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade—our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. 
3154	@BarackObama	a	Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the “million different centers of energy and daring” that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. 
3155	@BarackObama	a	Today I’m proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates – leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent:

3157	@BarackObama	a	This week, I’m traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office – a continent of wonderful diversity, thriving culture, and remarkable stories. As I prepare for this trip, I wanted to share a list of books that I’d recommend for summer reading: 
3158	@BarackObama	a	“Low plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.” This is how I’ll remember Tony. He taught us about food — but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We’ll miss him. 
3159	@BarackObama	a	This National Gun Violence Awareness Day, show your commitment to keeping our kids safe from gun violence. Then, for everyone we’ve lost, take action to change our leadership and our laws until they reflect that commitment - no matter how long it takes. 
3160	@BarackObama	a	We can never truly repay the debt we owe our fallen heroes. But we can remember them, honor their sacrifice, and affirm in our own lives those enduring ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity for which generations of Americans have given that last full measure of devotion.

3163	@BarackObama	a	There are few issues more important to the security of the US than the potential spread of nuclear weapons or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. Today’s decision to put the JCPOA at risk is a serious mistake. My full statement: 
3164	@BarackObama	a	These talented young people will create a better future not just in Africa, but around the world. I can’t wait to spend some time with @ObamaFoundation Leaders and look forward to honoring the Mandela legacy in Johannesburg this summer. 
3165	@BarackObama	a	Our statement on the passing of Former First Lady Barbara Bush: 
3166	@BarackObama	a	Our most important task as a nation is to make sure all our young people can achieve their dreams.

3171	@BarackObama	a	Four years ago, @MichelleObama and I had the privilege to host Lt. Cmdr. Dan Cnossen and his fellow Paralympians and Olympians at the White House. Today, we’re so proud of him for winning gold and silver - while still representing the red, white, and blue. 
3172	@BarackObama	a	I got my start holding community meetings in Chicago, so it was fun to be home for one tonight. Michelle and I want the world to come together on the South Side at a place built with local ideas, values, and hopes. That’s the @ObamaFoundation and Presidential Center.

3174	@BarackObama	a	Ten-year-old Jahkil Jackson is on a mission to help homeless people in Chicago. He created kits full of socks, toiletries, and food for those in need. Just this week, Jahkil reached his goal to give away 5,000 “blessing bags.” That’s a story from 2017. 
3175	@BarackObama	a	Chris Long gave his paychecks from the first six games of the NFL season to fund scholarships in Charlottesville, VA. He wanted to do more, so he decided to give away an entire season’s salary. That’s a story from 2017.

4657	@justinbieber	a	Thanks for answering the call @JustinTrudeau . I’m a proud Canadian. Look forward to performance today @GlblCtzn 
4658	@justinbieber	a	#GlobalGoalUnite concert 2pm est @GlblCtzn https://t.co/3KTIV9xgxy 
4659	@justinbieber	a	My big brother @usher just dropped #Icry  - Proceeds from the record will be donated to  @lisc_hq in support of Black-owned businesses.  Also watch his performance Sat during @glblctzn’s  #GlobalGoalUnite concert. #usher #icry #blacklivesmatter 
4660	@justinbieber	a	I’m joining the #GlobalGoalUnite for Our Future concert on June 27th to combat the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has on communities of color and call on world leaders to make testing, treatments &amp; vaccines available to everyone everywhere https://t.co/3KTIV9xgxy 
4661	@justinbieber	a	On march 10th selena left for work and I stayed at the Westin as the receipts clearly showed with my friends nick and john before I left town. Once again not at the four seasons. We booked it for a couple days to stay for the defjam show but I bailed on the 11th to head back home 
4662	@justinbieber	a	The Pics I showed of me and Selena march 9 in Austin  should make it clear that we were together that night and went from the venue to our Airbnb and never went to the four seasons. This is our airbnb receipt where we crashed with our friends 
4663	@justinbieber	a	Furthermore I stayed with Selena and our friends at an airbnb on the 9th and on the 10th stayed at a Westin because our hotel reservation at LÀ Quinta and not the four seasons was messed up. Here are the receipts for the hotel on the 10th 
4664	@justinbieber	a	However I never stayed at the four seasons on the 9th or the 10th. This person put another tweet up earlier saying they saw me at the restaurant the following night not the hotel 
4665	@justinbieber	a	The other reason this story might say I was staying at the four seasons was because a tweet from 2014 on March 10th not the the 9th says they saw me there . This is that tweet 
4666	@justinbieber	a	Here is article that shows we didn’t arrive in Austin that night from Selena’s show in Houston until late in the night. 
4667	@justinbieber	a	These photos clearly show me on stage with my assistant sidestage and the other with both of us in the streets of Austin afterwards on March 9 2014 
4668	@justinbieber	a	This article from 2014 talks about Selena being there with me. 
4669	@justinbieber	a	This is an action that can make change! In 2020, it’s time to take back the power. Join us as we work to register voters across the nation #MarchOnBallotBoxes https://t.co/BKM7fS2ElP

4673	@justinbieber	a	Canada. We gotta stand up for each other at home and people around the world. Join me and @GlblCtznCAN to help ask @JustinTrudeau to commit to fight coronavirus worldwide with other nations. Take action here:
